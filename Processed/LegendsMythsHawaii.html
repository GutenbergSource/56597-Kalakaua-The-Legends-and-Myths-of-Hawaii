<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For material in the compilation of many of the legends
embraced in this volume obligation is acknowledged to H. R. H.
Liliuokalani; General John Owen Dominis; His Excellency Walter M.
Gibson; Professor W. D. Alexander; Mrs. E. Beckley, Government
Librarian; Mr. W. James Smith, Secretary of the National Board of
Education; and especially to Hon. Abram Fornander, the learned author
of &ldquo;An Account of the Polynesian Race, its Origin and
Migrations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The legends, in the order of their publication, beginning with the
first and ending with &ldquo;The Destruction of the Temples,&rdquo; may
be regarded, so far as they refer to the prominent political events
with which they are associated, as in a measure historic. Those
following have been selected as the most striking and characteristic of
what remains of the fabulous folk-lore of the Hawaiian group.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The legends following are of a group of sunny islands
lying almost midway between Asia and America&mdash;a cluster of
volcanic craters and coral-reefs, where the mountains are mantled in
perpetual green and look down upon valleys of eternal spring; where for
two-thirds of the year the trade-winds, sweeping down from the
northwest coast of America and softened in their passage southward,
dally with the stately cocoas and spreading palms, and mingle their
cooling breath with the ever-living fragrance of fruit and blossom.
Deeply embosomed in the silent wastes of the broad Pacific, with no
habitable land nearer than two thousand miles, these islands greet the
eye of the approaching mariner like a shadowy paradise, suddenly lifted
from the blue depths by the malicious spirits of the world of waters,
either to lure him to his destruction or disappear as he drops his
anchor by the enchanted shore.</p>

height="457">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Mahiole, or Feathered
War-Helmet.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The legends are of a little archipelago which was unknown to the
civilized world until the closing years of the last century, and of a
people who for many centuries exchanged no word or product with the
rest of mankind; who had lost all knowledge, save the little retained
by the dreamiest of legends, of the great world beyond their island
home; whose origin may be traced to the ancient Cushites of Arabia, and
whose legends repeat the story of the Jewish genesis; who developed and
passed through <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>an age of chivalry somewhat more barbarous,
perhaps, but scarcely less affluent in deeds of enterprise and valor
than that which characterized the contemporaneous races of the
continental world; whose chiefs and priests claimed kinship with the
gods, and step by step told back their lineage not only to him who rode
the floods, but to the sinning pair whose re-entrance to the forfeited
joys of Paradise was prevented by the large, white bird of <i lang=
"haw">Kane</i>; who fought without shields and went to their death
without fear; whose implements of war and industry were of wood, stone
and bone, yet who erected great temples to their gods, and constructed
barges and canoes which they navigated by the stars; who peopled the
elements with spirits, reverenced the priesthood, bowed to the
revelations of their prophets, and submitted without complaint to the
oppressions of the <i lang="haw">tabu</i>; who observed the rite of
circumcision, built places of refuge after the manner of the ancient
Israelites, and held sacred the religious legends of the priests and
chronological <i lang="haw">meles</i> of the chiefs.</p>
<p>As the mind reverts to the past of the Hawaiian group, and dwells
for a moment upon the shadowy history of its people, mighty forms rise
and disappear&mdash;men of the stature of eight or nine feet, crowned
with helmets of feathers and bearing spears thirty feet in length. Such
men were Kiha, and Liloa, and Umi, and Lono, all kings of Hawaii during
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; and little less in bulk and none
the less in valor was the great Kamehameha, who conquered and
consolidated the several islands under one government, and died as late
as 1819. And beside Umi, whose life was a romance, stands his humble
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>friend Maukaleoleo, who, with his feet upon the
ground, could reach the cocoanuts of standing trees; and back of him in
the past is seen Kana, the son of Hina, whose height was measured by
paces.</p>

<p>And, glancing still farther backward through the centuries, we
behold adventurous chiefs, in barges and double canoes a hundred feet
in length, making the journey between the Hawaiian and more southern
groups, guided only by the sun and stars. Later we see battles, with
dusky thousands in line. The warriors are naked to the loins, and are
armed with spears, slings, clubs, battle-axes, javelins and knives of
wood or ivory. They have neither bows nor shields. They either catch
with their hands or ward with their own the weapons that are thrown.
Their chiefs, towering above them in stature, have thrown off their
gaudy feather cloaks and helmets, and, with spear and stone halberd,
are at the front of battle. The opposing forces are so disposed as to
present a right and left wing and centre, the king or principal chief
commanding the latter in person. In the rear of each hostile line are a
large number of women with calabashes of food and water with which to
refresh their battling fathers, husbands and brothers. While the battle
rages their wails, cries and prayers are incessant, and when defeat
menaces their friends they here and there take part in the combat. The
augurs have been consulted, sacrifices and promises to the gods have
been made, and, as the warring lines approach, the war-gods of the
opposing chiefs, newly decorated and attended by long-haired priests,
are borne to the front. War-cries and shouts of defiance follow. The
priests retire, and the slingers open the battle. Spears are thrown,
and soon the struggle is hand-to-hand all over the field. They fight in
groups and squads around their chiefs and leaders, who range the field
in search of enemies worthy of their weapons. No quarter is given or
expected. The first prisoners taken are reserved as offerings to the
gods, and are regarded as the most precious of sacrifices. Finally the
leading chief of one of the opposing armies falls. A desperate struggle
over his body ensues, and his dispirited followers begin to give ground
and are soon in retreat. Some escape to a stronghold in the neighboring
mountains, and a few, perhaps, to a temple of refuge; but the most of
them are overtaken and slain. The prisoners who are spared become the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>slaves of their captors, and the victory is
celebrated with feasting and bountiful sacrifices to the gods.</p>
<p>This is a representative battle of the past, either for the
supremacy of rival chiefs or in repelling invasion from a neighboring
island. But here and there we catch glimpses of actual conflicts
indicative of the warlike spirit and chivalry of the early Hawaiians.
Far back in the past we see the beautiful Hina abducted from her
Hawaiian husband by a prince of Molokai, and kept a prisoner in the
fortress of Haupu until her sons grow to manhood, when she is rescued
at the end of an assault which leaves the last of her defenders dead.
Later we see the eight hundred helmeted chiefs of the king of Hawaii,
all of noble blood, hurling themselves to destruction against the
spears of the armies of Maui on the plains of Wailuku. And then, less
than a generation after, Kamehameha is seen in the last battle of the
conquest, when, at the head of sixteen thousand warriors, he sweeps the
Oahuan army over the precipice of Nuuanu and becomes the master of the
archipelago. Finally we behold Kekuaokalani, the last defender in arms
of the Hawaiian gods and temples, trampling upon the edict of the king
against the worship of his fathers, and dying, with his faithful wife
Manono, on the field of Kuamoo.</p>
<p>In the midst of these scenes of blood the eye rests with relief upon
numerous episodes of love, friendship and self-sacrifice touching with
a softening color the ruddy canvas of the past. We see Kanipahu, the
exiled king of Hawaii, delving like a common laborer on a neighboring
island, and refusing to accept anew the sceptre in his old age because
his back had become crooked with toil and he could no longer look over
the heads of his subjects as became a Hawaiian king. We see Umi, a
rustic youth of royal mien and mighty proportions, boldly leap the
palace-walls of the great Liloa, push aside the spears of the guards,
enter the royal mansion, seat himself in the lap of the king, and
through the exhibition of a forgotten token of love receive instant
recognition as his son. And now Lono, the royal great-grandson of Umi,
rises before us, and we see him lured from self-exile by the voice of
his queen, reaching him in secret from without the walls of the
sovereign court of Oahu, to return to Hawaii and triumph over his
enemies. These and many other romantic incidents present themselves in
connection with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16"
name="pb16">16</a>]</span>early Hawaiian kings and princes, and are
offered in the succeeding pages with every detail of interest afforded
by available tradition.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A few general remarks concerning the physical
characteristics of the Hawaiian Islands would seem to be appropriate in
presenting a collection of legends dealing alike with the history and
folk-lore of their people. The islands occupy a place in a great waste
of the Pacific between the nineteenth and twenty-third degrees of north
latitude, and the one hundred and fifty-fourth and one hundred and
sixty-first degrees of longitude west from Greenwich. They are two
thousand one hundred miles southwest from San Francisco, and about the
same distance from Tahiti.</p>
<p>The group consists of ten islands, including two that are little
more than barren rocks. The farthest are about three hundred miles from
each other, measuring from their extreme boundaries, and their
aggregate area is a little more than six thousand one hundred square
miles. Of the eight principal islands all are habitable, although the
small islands of Niihau and Kahoolawe are used almost exclusively as
cattle-ranges.</p>
<p>The most of the shores of the several islands are fringed with
coral, but their origin seems to be indisputably shown in the numerous
craters of extinct volcanoes scattered throughout the group, and in the
mighty fires still blazing from the mountain-heights of Hawaii.</p>
<p>By far the larger part of the area of the islands is mountainous;
but from the interior elevations, some of them reaching altitudes of
from ten to fourteen thousand feet, flow many small streams of sweet
water, widening into fertile valleys as they reach the coast, while
here and there between them alluvial plateaus have been left by the
upland wash.</p>
<p>With rare exceptions the mountain-sides are covered with vegetation,
some of sturdy growth, capable of being wrought into building materials
and canoes, while lower down the <i lang="haw">ohia</i>, the palm, the
banana, and the bread-fruit stand clothed in perpetual green, with
groves of stately cocoas between them and the sea.</p>
<p>Once the fragrant sandal-wood was abundant in the mountains, but it
became an article of commerce with the natives in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>their
early intercourse with the white races, and is now rarely seen. Once
the valleys and plateaus were covered with growing <i lang=
"haw">taro</i> and potatoes; now the cane and rice of the foreigner
have usurped the places of both, and in the few shaded spots that have
been left him the forgiving and revengeless Hawaiian sadly chants his
wild songs of the past.</p>
<p>Neither within the memory of men nor the reach of their legends,
which extend back more than a thousand years, has there been an active
volcano in the group beyond the large island of Hawaii, which embraces
two-thirds of the solid area of the archipelago. The mighty crater of
Haleakala, more than thirty miles in circumference, on the island of
Maui, has slept in peace among the clouds for ages, and hundreds of
lesser and lower craters, many of them covered with vegetation, are
found scattered among the mountains and foot-hills of the group; but
their fires have long been extinct, and the scoria and ashes buried at
their bases tell the story of their activity far back in the past.</p>
<p>It must have been a sight too grand for human eyes to witness when
all these dead volcanic peaks, aglow with sulphurous flames, lit up the
moonless midnights of the eight Hawaiian seas with their combined
bombardment of the heavens!</p>
<p>On the island of Hawaii alone have the fires of nature remained
unextinguished. At intervals during the past thousand years or more
have Mauna Kea, Mauna Hualalai and Mauna Loa sent their devastating
streams of lava to the sea, and to-day the awful, restless and
ever-burning caldron of Kilauea, nearly a mile in circumference, is the
grandest conflagration that lights up the earth. Within its lurid
depths, in fiery grottoes and chambers of burning crystal, dwell
<i lang="haw">Pele</i> and her companions, and offerings are still
thrown to them by superstitious natives. Do they yet believe in these
deities after more than sixty years of Christian teaching? after their
temples have been leveled and their gods have been destroyed? after
their <i>tabus</i> have been broken and their priesthood has been
dethroned and dishonored? The only answer is, &ldquo;The offerings are
still made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the channel and ocean coasts of the islands are generally
bold, rocky and precipitous, there are numerous bays and indentations
partially sheltered by reefs and headlands, and many stretches of
smooth and yellow beach, where the waves, touched by the <i lang=
"haw">kona</i>, or the trade-wind&rsquo;s breath, chase each other
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>high up among the cocoa&rsquo;s roots and branches
of the humble <i>hau</i>-tree clinging to the sands. The harbor of
Honolulu, on the island of Oahu, is the only one, however, where
passengers and freights of ocean crafts may be received or landed
without the aid of lighters.</p>
<p>The most of the useful and ornamental growths of the tropics now
flourish on the islands. The indigenous plants, however, are confined
to the banana, plantain, cocoanut, breadfruit, <i lang="haw">ohia</i>,
sugar-cane, arrow-root, yam, sweet potato, <i lang="haw">taro</i>,
strawberry, raspberry and <i lang="haw">ohelo</i>. The lime, orange,
mango, tamarind, papaia, guava, and every other edible product, aside
from those named as indigenous, are importations of the past
century.</p>
<p>The only domestic animals of the ancient Hawaiians were dogs, swine
and fowls, and the most formidable four-legged creatures found in their
fields and forests were mice and lizards. Wild geese, including a
species peculiar to the islands, ducks, snipe and plover were abundant
in their seasons, but seem to have been sparely eaten; and owls, bats,
and a few varieties of birds of simple song and not over-brilliant
plumage made up about the sum total of animal life on the islands a
hundred years ago. But the native could well afford to be content with
this limited provision, since it did not include snakes, mosquitoes,
centipedes, tarantulas, or scorpions.</p>
<p>To what processes of creation or isolation do the Hawaiian Islands
owe their existence? Were they raised from the depths of the ocean by
volcanic action, as plainly suggested by their formation? or are they a
part of a great sunken continent which speculation, sustained by misty
tradition, claims once occupied the Polynesian seas? Hawaiian <i lang=
"haw">meles</i> mention islands no longer to be found, and the facility
with which communication was maintained between the Hawaiian and more
southern groups previous to the twelfth century renders plausible the
assumption that this intercourse was abruptly terminated six or seven
centuries ago by the disappearance of a number of intervening atolls or
islands which had served as guides to early Polynesian navigators. The
gigantic ruins of temples and other structures found on Easter and one
or two other islands of the equatorial Pacific are almost unanswerable
arguments in favor of the theory of a sunken Polynesian continent; but
the question will probably never be removed beyond the field of
surmise. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=

<h3 class="main">HISTORIC OUTLINES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The source and early history of the Hawaiian people,
and, in fact, of the Polynesian race, of which they are a part, are
involved in doubt. They have generally been regarded as an offshoot of
the great Malayan family; but more recent as well as more thorough
investigation, particularly by Judge Fornander, the learned and
conscientious historian, with reasonable conclusiveness shows the
Polynesian and Malayan races to be of distinct and widely different
origin.</p>
<p>Accepting this conclusion, we trace the strictly Polynesian tribes
to an Aryan beginning, somewhere in Asia Minor or Arabia. There, in the
remote past, it is assumed, they were brought in close contact with
early Cushite and Chaldeo-Arabian civilizations. Subsequently drifting
into India, they to some extent amalgamated with the Dravidian races,
and, following the channels of the great Chaldean commerce of that
period, at length found a home in the Asiatic archipelago from Sumatra
to Luzon and Timor.</p>
<p>The exact time of their settlement on the large coast islands of
southern Asia cannot be definitely determined, but their legends and
genealogies leave little room to doubt that it was contemporaneous with
the Malay and Hindoo invasions of Sumatra, Java, and other islands of
the archipelago, during the first and second centuries of the Christian
era, that the Polynesians were pushed out&mdash;not at once in a body,
but by families and communities covering a period of years&mdash;to the
smaller and more remote islands of the Pacific.</p>
<p>Their first general rendezvous was in the Fiji group, where they
left their impress upon the native Papuans. Expelled from, or
voluntarily leaving, the Fijis, after a sojourn there of several
generations, the Polynesians scattered over the Pacific, occupying by
stages the several groups of islands where they are now found. Moving
by the way of the Samoan and Society Islands, the migratory wave did
not reach the Hawaiian group until about the middle of the sixth
century.</p>
<p>Nanaula, a distinguished chief, was the first to arrive from the
southern islands. It is not known whether he discovered the group by
being blown northward by adverse winds, or in deliberately adventuring
far out upon the ocean in search of new <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>lands. In either event,
he brought with him his gods, priests, prophets and astrologers, and a
considerable body of followers and retainers. He was also provided with
dogs, swine and fowls, and the seeds and germs of useful plants for
propagation. It is probable that he found the group without human
inhabitants.</p>
<p>During that period&mdash;probably during the life of
Nanaula&mdash;other chiefs of less importance arrived with their
families and followers either from Tahiti or Samoa. They came in barges
and large double canoes capable of accommodating from fifty to one
hundred persons each. They brought with them not only their priests and
gods, but the earliest of Polynesian traditions. It is thought that
none of the pioneers of the time of Nanaula ever returned to the
southern islands, nor did others immediately follow the first migratory
wave that peopled the Hawaiian group.</p>
<p>For thirteen or fourteen generations the first occupants of the
Hawaiian Islands lived sequestered from the rest of the world,
multiplying and spreading throughout the group. They erected temples to
their gods, maintained their ancient religion, and yielded obedience to
their chiefs. The traditions of the period are so meagre as to leave
the impression that it was one of uninterrupted peace, little having
been preserved beyond the genealogies of the governing chiefs.</p>
<p>But late in the tenth or early in the beginning of the eleventh
century the Hawaiians were aroused from their dream of more than four
centuries by the arrival of a party of adventurers from the southern
islands, probably from the Society group. It was under the leadership
of Nanamaoa. He was a warlike chief, and succeeded in establishing his
family in power on Hawaii, Maui and Oahu. But stronger leaders were
soon to follow from the south. Among the first was the high-priest
Paao, from Samoa. He arrived during the reign of Kapawa, the grandson
of Nanamaoa, or immediately after his death. The people were in an
unsettled condition politically, and Paao, grasping the situation,
either sent or returned in person to Samoa for Pili, a distinguished
chief of that island. Arriving with a large following, Pili assumed the
sovereignty of the island of Hawaii and founded a new dynasty. Paao
became his high-priest, and somewhat disturbed the religious practices
of the people by the introduction <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21"
href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>of new rites and two or three
new gods. However, his religion did not seem to differ greatly from
that of the native priests, and from him the last of the priesthood,
seven hundred years after, claimed lineage and right of place.</p>
<p>The intercourse thus established between the Hawaiian and southern
groups by Nanamaoa, Paao and Pili continued for about one hundred and
fifty years, or until the middle or close of the twelfth century.
During that period several other warlike families from the south
established themselves in the partial or complete sovereignty of Oahu,
Maui and Kauai, and expeditions were frequent between the group and
other distant islands of Polynesia. It was a season of unusual
activity, and the legends of the time are filled with stories of love,
conquest and perilous voyages to and from the southern islands.</p>
<p>In that age, when distant voyages were frequent, the Polynesians
were bold and intelligent navigators. In addition to large double
canoes capable of withstanding the severest weather, they possessed
capacious barges, with planks corded and calked upon strong frames.
They were decked over and carried ample sail. Their navigators had some
knowledge of the stars; knew the prominent planets and gave them names;
were acquainted with the limits of the ecliptic and situation of the
equator. With these helps, and keenly watchful of the winds and
currents, of ocean drifts and flights of birds, they seldom failed to
reach their destination, however distant.</p>
<p>Near the close of the twelfth century all communication between the
Hawaiian and southern groups suddenly ceased. Tradition offers no
explanation of the cause, and conjecture can find no better reason for
it than the possible disappearance at that time of a number of island
landmarks which had theretofore served as guides to the mariner. The
beginning of this period of isolation found the entire group, with the
exception, perhaps, of Molokai and a portion of Oahu, in the possession
of the southern chiefs or their descendants.</p>
<p>It has been observed that the first discovery and occupation of the
islands by Polynesians from the Society and Samoan groups occurred in
the sixth century, and that more than four hundred years later a second
migratory tide from the same and possibly other southern islands
reached the coasts of Hawaii, continuing for more than a century and a
half, and completely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22"
name="pb22">22</a>]</span>changing the political, and to some extent
the social, condition of the people. Although nearly five centuries
elapsed between the first and second migratory influxes from the south,
during which the inhabitants of the group held no communication with
the rest of the world, it is a curious fact that the Pili, Paumakua,
and other chiefly families of the second influx traced back their
lineage to the ancestors of the chiefs of the first migration, and made
good their claim to the relationship by the recital of legends and
genealogies common to both.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Princess Liliuokalani.</p>
</div>
<p>At the close of the second migratory period, which concluded their
intercourse with the world beyond them for more than six hundred years,
or from <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1175 to 1778, the people of the
group had very generally transferred their allegiance to the
newly-arrived chiefs. The notable exceptions were the Maweke and
Kamauaua families of Oahu and Molokai, both of the ancient Nanaula
line. Although they were gradually crowded from their possessions by
their more energetic invaders, the high descent of the prominent native
chiefs was recognized, and by intermarriage their blood was allowed to
mingle with the royal currents which have flowed down the centuries
since they ceased to rule.</p>
<p>A mere outline of the political history of the islands from the
twelfth century to the nineteenth is all that will be given here. The
legends following will supply much that will be omitted to avoid
repetition.</p>
<p>Until the final conquest of the group by Kamehameha I. at the close
of the last century, the five principal islands of the
archipelago&mdash;Hawaii, Maui, Oahu, Kauai and Molokai&mdash;were each
governed, as a rule, by one or more independent chiefs. The smaller
islands of Lanai and Kahoolawe were usually subject to Maui, while
Niihau always shared the political fate of Kauai.</p>
<p>On each island, however, were descendants of distinguished ancient
chiefs and heroes, who were recognized as of superior or royal blood,
and with them originated the supreme chiefs, kings, or <i lang=
"haw">mois</i> of the several islands, whose lines continued in
authority, with interruptions of insurrection and royal feuds, until
the consolidation of the group by Kamehameha. No one was recognized as
a <i lang="haw">tabu</i> chief unless his genealogical record showed
him to be of noble blood, and intermarriage between the ruling
families, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>as well as between the lesser chiefs of the
several islands, in time united the entire aristocracy of the group by
ties of blood, and gave to all of royal strain a common and
distinguished ancestry. The nobility and hereditary priesthood claimed
to be of a stock different from that of the common people, and their
superior stature and intelligence seemed to favor the assumption. To
keep pure the blood of the chiefly classes, far back in the past a
college of heraldry was established, before which all chiefs were
required to recite their genealogies and make good their claims to
noble descent.</p>
<p>The legends of the group abound in stories of romantic and
sanguinary internal conflicts, and political and predatory wars between
the islands; but down to the time of Kamehameha but a single attempt
had been made to subjugate the entire archipelago. This bold scheme was
entertained by a king of the island of Hawaii who reigned during the
latter part of the thirteenth century. He succeeded in overrunning
Maui, Oahu and Molokai, but was defeated and taken prisoner on
Kauai.</p>
<p>Without further reference to the intervening years from the twelfth
century to the eighteenth&mdash;a long period of wars, festivals,
tournaments, and royal and priestly pageantry&mdash;we will now glance
at the condition of the islands at the time of their discovery by
Captain Cook, a little more than a century ago. It was estimated that
the islands then contained a population of four hundred thousand souls.
This estimate has been considered large. But when it is noted that
fifteen years later there were between thirty and forty thousand
warriors under arms in the group at the same time, with large reserves
ready for service, the conclusion is irresistible that the population
could scarcely have been less. Kamehameha invaded Oahu with sixteen
thousand warriors, principally drawn from the island of Hawaii. He was
opposed by eight or ten thousand spears, while as many more awaited his
arrival on Kauai. According to the figures of the Rev. Mr. Ellis, who
travelled around the island of Hawaii in 1821 and numbered the
dwellings and congregations addressed by him in the several coast
districts through which he passed, the number of people on that island
alone could not have been less than one hundred and fifteen
thousand.</p>
<p>At the time of the arrival of Captain Cook, Kalaniopuu, of the
ancient line of Pili, was king of the large island of Hawaii,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>and also maintained possession of a portion of the
island of Maui. Kahekili, &ldquo;the thunderer,&rdquo; as his name
implied, was <i lang="haw">moi</i> of Maui, and the principal wife of
Kalaniopuu was his sister. Kahahana, who was also related to Kahekili,
was the king of Oahu and claimed possession of Molokai and Lanai.
Kamakahelei was the nominal queen of Kauai and Niihau, and her husband
was a younger brother to Kahekili, while she was related to the royal
family of Hawaii. Thus, it will be seen, the reigning families of the
several islands of the group were all related to each other, as well by
marriage as by blood. So had it been for many generations. But their
wars with each other were none the less vindictive because of their
kinship, or attended with less of barbarity in their hours of
triumph.</p>
<p>At that time Kahekili was plotting for the downfall of Kahahana and
the seizure of Oahu and Molokai, and the queen of Kauai was disposed to
assist him in these enterprises. The occupation of the Hana district of
Maui by the kings of Hawaii had been the cause of many stubborn
conflicts between the chivalry of the two islands, and when Captain
Cook first landed on Hawaii he found the king of that island absent on
another warlike expedition to Maui, intent upon avenging his defeat of
two years before, when his famous brigade of eight hundred nobles was
hewn in pieces.</p>
<p>Connected with the court of Kalaniopuu at that time was a silent and
taciturn chief, who had thus far attracted but little attention as a
military leader. He was a man of gigantic mould, and his courage and
prowess in arms were undoubted; yet he seldom smiled or engaged in the
manly sports so attractive to others, and his friends were the few who
discerned in him a slumbering greatness which subsequently gave him a
name and fame second to no other in Hawaiian history. He was the
reputed and accepted son of Keoua, the half-brother of Kalaniopuu,
although it was believed by many that his real father was Kahekili,
<i lang="haw">moi</i> of Maui. But, however this may have been, he was
of royal blood, and was destined to become not only the king of Hawaii,
but the conqueror and sovereign of the group. This chief was
Kamehameha.</p>
<p>Such, in brief, was the political condition of the islands when
Captain Cook arrived. He was an officer in the English navy, and, with
the war-ships <i>Resolution</i> and <i>Discovery</i>, was on a voyage
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>in search of a northwest passage eastward from
Behring&rsquo;s Straits. Leaving the Society group in December, 1777,
on the 18th of the following month he sighted Oahu and Kauai. Landing
on the latter island and Niihau, he was received as a god by the
natives, and his ships were provided with everything they required.
Without then visiting the other islands of the group, he left for the
northwest coast of America on the 2d of February, 1778, and in November
of that year returned to the islands, first sighting the shores of
Molokai and Maui. Communicating with the wondering natives of the
latter island, he sailed around the coasts of Hawaii, and on the 17th
of January dropped his anchors in Kealakeakua Bay. He was hailed as a
reincarnation of their god <i lang="haw">Lono</i> by the people, and
the priests conducted him to their temples and accorded him divine
honors. Returning from his campaign in Maui, the king visited and
treated him as a god, and his ships were bountifully supplied with
pigs, fowls, vegetables and fruits. The ships left the bay on the 4th
of February, but, meeting with a storm, returned on the 8th for
repairs. Petty bickerings soon after occurred between the natives and
white sailors, and on the 13th one of the ships&rsquo; boats was stolen
by a chief and broken up for its nails and other iron fastenings. Cook
demanded its restoration, and, while endeavoring to take the king on
board the <i>Resolution</i> as a prisoner, was set upon by the natives
and slain. Fire was opened by the ships, and many natives, including
four or five chiefs, were killed. The body of Cook was borne off by the
natives, but the most of the bones were subsequently returned at the
request of Captain King, and the vessels soon after left the
island.</p>
<p>If Captain Cook was not the first of European navigators to discover
the Hawaiian Islands, he was at least the first to chart and make their
existence known to the world. It has been pretty satisfactorily
established that Juan Gaetano, the captain of a Spanish galleon sailing
from the Mexican coast to the Spice Islands, discovered the group as
early as 1555. But he did not make his discovery known at the time, and
the existence of an old manuscript chart in the archives of the Spanish
government is all that remains to attest his claim to it.</p>
<p>Native traditions mention the landing of small parties of white men
on two or three occasions during the latter part of the sixteenth
century; but if the faces and ships of other races <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>were
seen by the Hawaiians in the time of Gaetano, their descendants had
certainly lost all knowledge of both two hundred or more years later,
for Cook was welcomed as a supernatural being by the awe-stricken
islanders, and his ships were described by them as floating islands. A
simple iron nail was to them a priceless jewel, and every act and word
betrayed an utter ignorance of everything pertaining to the white
races.</p>
<p>Kalaniopuu, the king of Hawaii, died in 1782, and Kamehameha,
through the assistance of three or four prominent chiefs, succeeded,
after a struggle of more than ten years, in securing to himself the
supreme authority over that island. This done, encouraged by the
prophets, assisted by his chiefs, and sustained by an unwavering faith
in his destiny, he conquered Maui, Oahu, Kauai and their dependencies,
and in 1795 was recognized as the sole master of the group.</p>
<p>Although of royal stock, the strain of Kamehameha from the old line
of kings was less direct than that of his cousin, Kiwalao, from whom he
wrested the Hawaiian sceptre; but his military genius rallied around
him the warlike chiefs who were dissatisfied with the division of lands
by the son and successor of Kalaniopuu, and in the end his triumph was
complete. To farther ennoble his succession he married the daughter of
his royal cousin, and thus gave to his children an undoubted lineage of
supreme dignity.</p>
<p>The existence of the Hawaiian Islands became generally known to the
world soon after the final departure of the <i>Resolution</i> and
<i>Discovery</i>, but it was not until 1786 that vessels began to visit
the group. The first to arrive after the death of Captain Cook were the
English ships <i>King George</i> and <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, and the
same year a French exploring squadron touched at Maui. In 1787 several
trading vessels visited the group, and the natives began to barter
provisions and sandal-wood for fire-arms and other weapons of
metal.</p>
<p>In 1792, and again in 1793, Captain Vancouver, of an English
exploring squadron, touched and remained for some time at the islands.
He landed sheep, goats and horned cattle, and distributed a quantity of
fruit and garden seeds. His memory is gratefully cherished by the
natives, for his mission was one of peace and broad benevolence.
Thenceforward trading-vessels in considerable numbers visited the
group, and during the concluding wars of Kamehameha the rival chiefs
had secured the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>assistance of small parties of white men, and to
some extent had learned the use of muskets and small cannon, readily
purchased and paid for in sandal-wood, which was then quite abundant on
most of the timbered mountains of the islands. The harbor of Honolulu
was first discovered and entered by two American vessels in 1794, and
it soon became a favorite resort for the war, trading and whaling
vessels of all nations.</p>
<p>In the midst of these new and trying conditions Kamehameha managed
the affairs of his kingdom with distinguished prudence and sagacity. He
admonished his people to endure with patience the aggressions of the
whites, and to retain, as far as possible, their simple habits. With
his little empire united and peaceful, Kamehameha died on the 8th of
May, 1819, at the age of about eighty; and his bones were so secretly
disposed of that they have not yet been found.</p>
<p>Liholiho, the elder of his sons by Keopuolani, the daughter of his
cousin Kiwalao, succeeded his warlike father with the title of
Kamehameha II. Some knowledge of the Christian religion had reached the
natives through their white visitors, but the old chief died in the
faith of his fathers.</p>
<p>The death of Kamehameha was immediately followed by an event for
which history affords no parallel. In October, 1819&mdash;six months
before the first Christian missionaries arrived on the
islands&mdash;Liholiho, under the inspiration of Kaahumanu, one of the
widows of his father, suddenly, and in the presence of a large
concourse of horrified natives, broke the most sacred of the
<i>tabus</i> of his religion by partaking of food from vessels from
which women were feasting, and the same day decreed the destruction of
every temple and idol in the kingdom. He was sustained by the
high-priest Hewahewa, who was the first to apply the torch; and within
a few weeks idols, temples, altars, and a priesthood which had held
prince and subject in awe for centuries were swept away, leaving the
people absolutely without a religion.</p>
<p>But all did not peacefully submit to this royal edict against their
gods. In the twilight of that misty period looms up a grand defender of
the faith of Keawe and Umi and the altars of the Hawaiian gods. This
champion was Kekuaokalani, a nephew, perhaps a son, of the first
Kamehameha, and a cousin, perhaps a half-brother, of Liholiho. In his
veins coursed the royal blood of Hawaii, and his bearing was that of a
king. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>was above six and one-half feet in height, with
limbs well proportioned and features strikingly handsome and
commanding. He was of the priesthood, and, through the bestowal of some
<i>tabu</i> or prerogative, claimed to be second in authority to
Hewahewa, who traced his lineage back to Paao, the high-priest of Pili.
His wife, Manono, was scarcely less distinguished for her courage,
beauty and chiefly strain.</p>
<p>The apostasy of Hewahewa left Kekuaokalani at the head of the
priesthood&mdash;at least so he seems to have assumed&mdash;and the
royal order to demolish the temples was answered by him with an appeal
to the people to arm and join him in defence of their gods. He raised
the standard of revolt on the island of Hawaii, and was soon at the
head of a considerable army. A large force was sent against him, and
every effort was made to induce him to lay down his arms. But he
scorned all terms, refused all concessions.</p>
<p>A battle was fought at Kuamoo, at first favorable to the defenders
of the gods; but the fire-arms of the whites in the service of the king
turned the tide of war against them, and they were defeated and
scattered. Kekuaokalani was killed on the field, and Manono, his brave
and faithful wife, fighting by his side, fell dead upon the body of her
husband with a musket-ball through her temples. A rude monument of
stones still marks the spot where they fell; and it is told in whispers
that the <i lang="haw">kona</i>, passing through the shrouding vines,
attunes them to saddest tones of lamentation over the last defenders in
arms of the Hawaiian gods.</p>
<p>Four or five months before the death of Kekuaokalani, Kalaimoku, the
prime minister of Liholiho, and his brother Boki, were baptized under
the formula of the Roman Catholic Church by the chaplain of a French
corvette on a passing visit to the islands. They scarcely knew the
meaning of the ceremony, and it is safe to say that, at the time of the
destruction of their temples and the repudiation of their gods, the
Hawaiian people knew little or nothing of any other religion. The
abolition of the <i lang="haw">tabu</i>, which had made them slaves to
their chiefs and priests, and held their fathers in bondage for
centuries, was hailed with so great a joy by the native masses that
they did not hesitate when called upon to consign the priesthood and
their gods to the grave of the <i lang="haw">tabu</i>. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the 30th of March, 1820&mdash;some months after this strange
religious revolution&mdash;the first party of Christian missionaries
arrived at the islands from Massachusetts. They were well received.
They found a people without a religion, and their work was easy. Other
missionary parties followed from time to time, and found the field
alike profitable to the cause in which they labored and to themselves
individually. They acquired substantial possessions in their new home,
controlled the government for the fifty or more years following, and
their children are to-day among the most prosperous residents of the
group. This is not said with a view to undervalue the services of the
early missionaries to Hawaii, but to show that all missionary fields
have not been financially unfruitful to zealous and provident
workers.</p>
<p>And now let it be remarked with emphasis that the value of
missionary labors in the Hawaiian group should not be measured by the
small number of natives who to-day may be called Christians, but rather
by the counsel and assistance of these thrifty religious teachers in
securing and maintaining the independence of the islands, and by
degrees establishing a mild and beneficent constitutional government,
under which taxation is as light and life and property are as secure as
in any other part of the civilized world. They were politicians as well
as religious instructors, and practical examples of the value of
Christian discipline when prudently applied to the acquisition of the
needful and inviting things of life, and the establishment of a civil
system capable of protecting the possessor in his acquired rights.</p>
<p>In 1824 Liholiho and his queen died while on a visit to England, and
their remains were sent back to the islands in an English man-of war.
Kauikeaouli, a youth of ten years, and brother of the deceased king,
was accepted as the rightful heir to the throne under the title of
Kamehameha III., and Kaahumanu, one of the wives of Kamehameha I.,
acted as regent and prime minister.</p>
<p>In 1827, and ten years later, Roman Catholic missionaries arrived,
and were sent away by order of the government; but in 1839 the priests
of that denomination were finally landed under the guns of a French
frigate and allowed to remain. Meantime churches, schools and
printing-presses had been established, the Hawaiian had become a
written language, and the laws and decrees of the government were
promulgated in printed form. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href=
"#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span></p>
<p>In 1840 the first written constitution was given to the people,
guaranteeing to them a representative government. In February, 1843,
Lord Paulet, of the English navy, took formal possession of the
islands, but in the July following their sovereignty was restored
through the action of Admiral Thomas. In November of the same year
France and England mutually agreed to refrain from seizure or
occupation of the islands, or any portion of them, and the United
States, while declining to become a party to the agreement, promptly
acknowledged the independence of the group.</p>

</div>
<p>Kamehameha III. died in 1854 and was succeeded by Kamehameha IV. The
latter reigned until 1863, when he died and was succeeded by Prince
Lot, with the title of Kamehameha V. In 1864 Lot abrogated the
constitution of 1840 and granted a new one. He reigned until 1872, and
died without naming a successor, and the Legislative Assembly elected
Lunalilo to the throne. He was of the Kamehameha family, and with his
death, in 1873, the Kamehameha dynasty came to an end. He, too, failed
to designate a successor, and as but two of the accepted descendants of
the first Kamehameha remained&mdash;one a sister of Kamehameha V. and
the other a female cousin of that sovereign&mdash;David Kalakaua was
elected to the throne by the Legislative Assembly in 1874, receiving
all but five votes of that body, which were cast for the queen-dowager
Emma, widow of Kamehameha IV.</p>
<p>Provision having been made for the event by a previous Legislative
Assembly, King Kalakaua, with his queen, Kapiolani, was formally
crowned on the 12th of February, 1883, in the presence of the
representatives of many of the nations of the Old World and the New.
Since the coronation the last of the Kamehamehas has passed away,
including the queen-dowager Emma, and King Kalakaua remains the most
direct representative in the kingdom of the ancient sovereigns of
Hawaii. He draws his strain from Liloa through the great I family of
Hawaii, who joined their fortunes with the first Kamehameha in the
conquest of the group. His queen, Kapiolani, is a granddaughter of the
last independent sovereign of Kauai, and is thus allied in blood with
the early rulers of the group. She is childless, and the Princess
Liliuokalani, the elder of the two sisters of the king, has been named
as his successor. She is the wife of His Excellency <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>John O.
Dominis, an American by birth and present governor of the islands of
Oahu and Maui. The only direct heir in the families of the king and his
two sisters is the Princess Kaiulani, daughter of the Princess
Likelike,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e680src" href="#xd26e680" name=
"xd26e680src">1</a> wife of Mr. Cleghorn, a merchant of Honolulu.</p>
<p>Following is a list of the sovereigns of Hawaii, with the dates and
durations of their several governments, from the eleventh to the
nineteenth century. It embraces only the rulers of the island of
Hawaii, who eventually became the masters of the group. Until the reign
of Kalaniopuu, which began in 1754, the dates are merely
approximate:</p>

<p>Having thus briefly sketched the outlines of the prominent political
events of the islands, the ancient religion of the Hawaiians will next
be referred to; and as the <i lang="haw">tabu</i> was no less a
religious than a secular prerogative, it may properly be considered in
connection with the priesthood. A knowledge of the power, scope and
sanctity of the <i lang="haw">tabu</i> is essential to a proper
understanding of the relations existing in the past between the people
and their political and religious rulers, and this great governing
force will now claim our attention.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE TABU.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Strictly speaking, the ancient <i lang="haw">tabu</i>,
or <i lang="haw">kapu</i>, was a prerogative adhering exclusively to
political and ecclesiastical rank. It was a command either to do or not
to do, and the meaning of it was, &ldquo;Obey or die.&rdquo; It was
common to the Polynesian tribes, and was a protection to the lives,
property and dignity of the priesthood and nobility.</p>
<p>The religious <i>tabus</i> were well understood by the people, as
were also the personal or perpetual <i>tabus</i> of the ruling
families; but the incidental <i>tabus</i> were oppressive, irksome and
dangerous to the masses, as they were liable to be thoughtlessly
violated, and death was the usual penalty.</p>
<p>Everything pertaining to the priesthood and temples was sacred, or
<i>tabu</i>, and pigs designed for sacrifice, and running at large with
the temple mark upon them, could not be molested. It was a violation of
perpetual <i>tabu</i> to cross the shadow of the king, to stand in his
presence without permission, or to approach him except upon the knees.
This did not apply to the higher grades of chiefs, who themselves
possessed <i>tabu</i> rights.</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p032width" id="p032"><img src=
"images/p032.png" alt="The Puloulou, or Tabu Mark." width="234" height=

<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">The Puloulou, or Tabu
Mark.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Favorite paths, springs, streams and bathing-places were at
intervals <i>tabued</i> to the exclusive use of the kings and temples,
and squid, turtle, and two or three species of birds could be eaten
only by the priests and <i>tabu</i> nobility.</p>
<p>Yellow was the <i>tabu</i> color of royalty, and red of the
priesthood, and mantles of the feathers of the <i lang="haw">oo</i> and
<i lang="haw">mamo</i> could be worn only by kings and princes. Feather
capes of mingled red and yellow distinguished the lesser nobility.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span></p>
<p>Women were <i>tabued</i> from eating plantains, bananas, and
cocoanuts; also the flesh of swine and certain fish, among them the
<i lang="haw">kumu</i>, <i lang="haw">moano</i>, <i lang=
"haw">ulua</i>, <i lang="haw">honu</i>, <i lang="haw">ea</i>, <i lang=
"haw">hahalua</i> and <i lang="haw">naia</i>; and men and women were
allowed under no circumstances to partake of food together. Hence, when
Liholiho, in 1819, openly violated this fundamental <i>tabu</i> by
eating with his queen, he defied the gods of his fathers and struck at
the very foundation of the religious faith of his people.</p>
<p>The general <i>tabus</i> declared by the supreme chief or king were
proclaimed by heralds, while the <i lang="haw">puloulou</i>&mdash;a
staff surmounted by a crown of white or black <i lang=
"haw">kapa</i>&mdash;placed at the entrance of temples, royal
residences and the mansions of <i>tabu</i> chiefs, or beside springs,
groves, paths, or bathing-places, was a standing notification against
trespass. General <i>tabus</i> were declared either to propitiate the
gods or in celebration of important events. They were either common or
strict, and frequently embraced an entire district and continued from
one to ten days.</p>
<p>During the continuance of a common <i>tabu</i> the masses were
merely required to abstain from their usual occupations and attend the
services at the <i lang="haw">heiaus</i>, or temples; but during a
strict <i>tabu</i> every fire and every light was extinguished, no
canoe was shoved from the shore, no bathing was permitted, the pigs and
fowls were muzzled or placed under calabashes that they might utter no
noise, the people conversed in whispers, and the priests and their
assistants were alone allowed to be seen without their places of abode.
It was a season of deathly silence, and was thought to be especially
grateful to the gods.</p>
<p>Some of the royal <i>tabus</i>, centuries back in the past, were
frivolous and despotic, such as regulating the wearing of beards and
compelling all sails to be lowered on passing certain coast points;
but, however capricious or oppressive, the <i>tabu</i> was seldom
violated, and its maintenance was deemed a necessary protection to the
governing classes.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">ANCIENT HAWAIIAN RELIGION.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The ancient religion of the Hawaiians, of which the
<i>tabu</i> formed an essential feature, was a theocracy of curious
structure. It was a system of idolatrous forms and sacrifices engrafted
without consistency upon the Jewish story of the creation, the fall of
man, the revolt of Lucifer, the Deluge, and the repopulation of the
earth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>The legends of the Hawaiians were preserved with marvellous
integrity. Their historians were the priests, who at intervals met in
council and recited and compared their genealogical <i lang=
"haw">meles</i>, in order that nothing might be either changed or lost.
How did the Hawaiian priesthood become possessed of the story of the
Hebrew genesis? It was old to them when the <i>Resolution</i> and
<i>Discovery</i> dropped their anchors in Kealakeakua Bay; old to them
when one or more chance parties of Spanish sailors in the sixteenth
century may have looked in upon them for a moment while on their way to
the Spice Islands; and it was probably old to them when the Hawaiians
found their present home in the sixth century, and when the Polynesians
left the coast of Asia four hundred years earlier.</p>
<div class="figure p034width" id="p034"><img src="images/p034.png" alt=
"Ancient Gods." width="694" height="610">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Ancient Gods.</span></p>
</div>
<p>One theory is that the story was acquired through Israelitish
contact with the ancestors of the Polynesians while the latter
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>were drifting eastward from the land of their
nativity. But the more reasonable assumption seems to be that the
Hawaiian theogony, so strangely perpetuated, is an independent and
perhaps original version of a series of creation legends common in the
remote past to the Cushite, Semite and Aryan tribes, and was handed
down quite as accurately as the Jewish version before it became fixed
in written characters. In fact, in some respects the Hawaiian seems to
be more complete than the Jewish version.</p>
<p>From the beginning, according to Hawaiian story, a trinity of gods
existed, who were the sole and all-pervading intelligences of chaos, or
night&mdash;a condition represented by the Hawaiian word <i lang=
"haw">Po</i>. These gods were:</p>
<p><i lang="haw">Kane</i>, the originator;</p>
<p><i lang="haw">Ku</i>, the architect and builder; and</p>
<p><i lang="haw">Lono</i>, the executor and director of the
elements.</p>
<p>By the united will of <i lang="haw">Hikapoloa</i>, or the trinity,
light was brought into chaos. They next created the heavens, three in
number, as their dwelling-places, and then the earth, sun, moon and
stars. From their spittle they next created a host of angels to
minister to their wants.</p>
<p>Finally, man was created. His body was formed of red earth mingled
with the spittle of <i lang="haw">Kane</i>, and his head of whitish
clay brought by <i lang="haw">Lono</i> from the four quarters of the
earth. The meaning of Adam is red, and it will be remarked that the
Hawaiian Adam was made of earth of that color. He was made in the image
of <i lang="haw">Kane</i>, who breathed into his nostrils, and he
became alive. Afterwards, from one of his ribs, taken from his side
while he slept, a woman was created. The man was called <i lang=
"haw">Kumu-honua</i>, and the woman <i lang=
"haw">Ke-ola-ku-honua</i>.</p>
<p>The newly-created pair were placed in a beautiful paradise called
<i lang="haw">Paliuli</i>. Three rivers of &ldquo;the waters of
life&rdquo; ran through it, on the banks of which grew every inviting
fruit, including the &ldquo;<i>tabued</i> bread-fruit tree&rdquo; and
&ldquo;sacred apple-tree,&rdquo; with which are connected the fall and
expulsion of the man and woman from their earthly paradise. The three
rivers had their source in a beautiful lake, fed by &ldquo;the living
waters of <i lang="haw">Kane</i>.&rdquo; The waters were filled with
fish which fire could not destroy, and on being sprinkled with them the
dead were restored to life. Legends relate instances in which these
waters were procured, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36"
name="pb36">36</a>]</span>through the favor of the gods, for the
restoration to life of distinguished mortals.</p>
<p>As a specimen of the chants perpetuating these traditions and
embellishing the plainer prose recitals, the following extract relating
to the creation is given:</p>

<p class="first">Among the angels created was <i lang=
"haw">Kanaloa</i>, the Hawaiian Lucifer, who incited a rebellion in
heaven, with the results, strangely enough, related in immortal song by
Milton. When man was created, <i lang="haw">Kanaloa</i> demanded his
adoration. This was refused by <i lang="haw">Kane</i>, as angels and
man were alike the creations of Deity, whereupon <i lang=
"haw">Kanaloa</i> ambitiously resolved to create a man of his own who
would worship him. <i lang="haw">Kane</i> allowed him to proceed with
his seditious work. He made a man in the exact image of <i lang=
"haw">Kumu-honua</i>, but could not give it life. He breathed into its
nostrils, but it would not rise; he called to it, but it would not
speak. This exasperated him, and he determined to destroy the man made
by the gods. He therefore crept into <i lang="haw">Paliuli</i> in the
form of a <i lang="haw">moo</i>, or lizard, and, through some deception
not definitely stated by tradition, <i lang="haw">Kumu-honua</i> and
his mate committed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37"
name="pb37">37</a>]</span>some offence for which they were driven from
paradise by the &ldquo;large, white bird of <i lang=
"haw">Kane</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i lang="haw">Kumu-honua</i> had three sons, the second of whom was
slain by the first. The name of the Hawaiian Cain is <i lang=
"haw">Laka</i>. <i lang="haw">Ka Pili</i> was the youngest son, and
thirteen generations are named between him and the Deluge, whereas the
Hebrew version records but ten on the corresponding line of Seth.</p>
<p>The Hawaiian Noah is called <i lang="haw">Nuu</i>. At the command of
the gods he constructed an ark, and entered it with his wife and three
sons, and a male and female of every breathing thing. The waters came
and covered the earth. When they subsided the gods entered the ark,
which was resting on a mountain overlooking a beautiful valley, and
commanded <i lang="haw">Nuu</i> to go forth with all of life that the
ark contained. In gratitude for his deliverance <i lang="haw">Nuu</i>
offered a sacrifice to the moon, mistaking it for <i lang=
"haw">Kane</i>. Descending on a rainbow, that deity reproved his
thoughtlessness, but left the bow as a perpetual token of his
forgiveness.</p>
<p>Continuing the genealogical record, ten generations are given
between <i lang="haw">Nuu</i> and <i lang="haw">Ku Pule</i>, who
&ldquo;removed to a southern country,&rdquo; taking with him as a wife
his slave-woman <i lang="haw">Ahu</i>. So was it with Abraham. <i lang=
"haw">Ku Pule</i> established the practice of circumcision, and was the
grandfather of <i lang="haw">Kini-lau-a-mano</i>, whose twelve children
became the founders of twelve tribes, from one of which&mdash;the
<i lang="haw">Menehune</i>&mdash;the Hawaiians are made to descend.</p>
<p>A story similar to that of Joseph is also given, and mention is made
of the subsequent return of the <i lang="haw">Menehune</i> people to
the land set apart for their occupation by <i lang="haw">Kane</i>. Two
brothers led them over deserts and through waters, and after many
tribulations they reached their destination.</p>
<p>This would seem to imply that the <i lang="haw">Menehune</i> people
were one of the tribes of Israel; yet it is more probable that they had
their origin in some one of the other twelveships into which the early
Asiatic tribes were in many instances divided, and that the stories of
Joseph and the Exodus became a part of their folk-lore through contact
with other races.</p>
<p>The genealogical line from the Hawaiian Adam to the grandson of
<i lang="haw">Ku Pule</i>&mdash;that is, until the time of
Jacob&mdash;has been brought down through three distinct traditional
channels. The agreement of the several versions is remarkable, but the
one brought to the islands by the high-priest Paao in the eleventh
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>century, and retained by his ecclesiastical
successors, is regarded as the most authentic. It was an heirloom of
the priesthood, and was never communicated beyond the walls of the
temples.</p>
<p>With the settlement of the <i lang="haw">Menehune</i> people in the
land set apart for them by <i lang="haw">Kane</i>, the Hawaiian legends
cease to remind us of the later history of the Hebrews. There the
similarity of historic incident abruptly ends, and, with an uncertain
stride of twelve or thirteen generations, the chiefly line is brought
down to <i lang="haw">Wakea</i> and his wife <i lang="haw">Papa</i>,
mythical rulers of superhuman attributes, who must have existed before
the Polynesians left the Asiatic coast, although in some legends they
are connected not only with the first settlement of the Hawaiian
archipelago, but with the creation of its islands.</p>
<p>A few of the many legends relating to the creation and first
settlement of the islands will be noted. One of them in substance is
that <i lang="haw">Hawaii-loa</i>, a distinguished chief, and fourth in
generation from <i lang="haw">Kini-lau-a-mano</i>, sailed westward,
and, guided by the Pleiades, discovered the Hawaiian group. He gave to
the largest island his own name, and to the others the names of his
children.</p>
<p>Another tradition refers to <i lang="haw">Papa</i>, the wife of
<i lang="haw">Wakea</i>, as a <i>tabued</i> descendant of <i lang=
"haw">Hawaii-loa</i>, and superior in caste to her husband. Mutual
jealousies embittered their lives and led to strange events. <i lang=
"haw">Wakea</i> found favor with the beautiful <i lang="haw">Hina</i>,
and the island of Molokai was born of their embrace. In retaliation
<i lang="haw">Papa</i> smiled upon the warrior <i lang="haw">Lua</i>,
and the fruit of their meeting was the fair island of Oahu. Hence the
old names of <i lang="haw">Molokai-Hina</i> and <i lang=
"haw">Oahu-a-Lua</i>.</p>
<p>Quite as fanciful a legend relates that an immense bird laid an egg
on the waters of the ocean. It was hatched by the warm winds of the
tropics, and the Hawaiian group came into being. Shortly after a man
and woman, with a pair each of dogs, hogs and fowls, came in a canoe
from Kahiki, landed on the eastern coast of Hawaii, and became the
progenitors of the Hawaiian people.</p>
<p>Fifty-six generations are mentioned from <i lang="haw">Wakea</i> to
the present ruling family. The legends of the twenty-nine generations
covering the period between <i lang="haw">Wakea</i> and
Maweke&mdash;which brings the record down to the eleventh century, when
the second migratory influx from the southern islands
occurred&mdash;abound in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href=
"#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>wars, rebellions and popular
movements, in which giants, demi-gods, and even the gods themselves
took part; and it was doubtless during that period that the idolatrous
forms and practices of the Hawaiian religion, as it existed a century
ago, were engrafted upon an older and simpler creed confined to the
worship of the godhead.</p>
<p>When the high-priest Paao arrived with Pili he introduced some new
gods while recognizing the old, strengthened and enlarged the scope of
the <i>tabu</i>, and established an hereditary priesthood independent
of, and second only in authority to, the supreme political head.
Different grades of priests also came into existence, such as seers,
prophets, astrologers and <i>kahunas</i> of various function, including
the power of healing and destroying. In fact, the priesthood embraced
ten distinct grades or colleges, each possessing and exercising powers
peculiar to it, and the mastery of all of them was one of the
qualifications of the high-priesthood. The tutelar deity of the entire
body was <i lang="haw">Uli</i>.</p>
<p>The form of the <i>heiau</i>, or temple, was changed by Paao and his
successors, and the masses mingled less freely in the ceremonies of
sacrifice and other forms of worship. The high-priesthood became more
mysterious and exclusive, and assumed prerogatives above the reach of
royalty. The old Hawaiian trinity&mdash;<i lang="haw">Kane</i>,
<i lang="haw">Ku</i> and <i lang="haw">Lono</i>&mdash;remained the
supreme gods of the pantheon, but <i lang="haw">Kanaloa</i>, the spirit
of evil, was accorded beneficent attributes and exalted among them.</p>
<p>The regions of <i lang="haw">Po</i>, or death, were presided over by
<i lang="haw">Milu</i>, a wicked king who once ruled on earth, while
the spirits of favorite chiefs were conveyed by the divine messenger
<i lang="haw">Kuahairo</i> to the presence of <i lang=
"haw">Kaono-hio-kala</i>, whose beatific abode was somewhere in the
heavens. Another belief was that the ruler of <i lang="haw">Po</i> was
<i lang="haw">Manua</i>, and that <i lang="haw">Milu</i> did not follow
<i lang="haw">Akea</i>, the first king of Hawaii, to that place, but
dwelt in a region far westward and beneath the sea. Although
significant of darkness, <i lang="haw">Po</i> was not without light.
Like Tartarus, it could be visited by favored mortals, and the dead
were sometimes brought back from it to earth.</p>
<p><i lang="haw">Pele</i>, the dreadful goddess of the volcanoes, with
her malignant relatives, was added to the Hawaiian deities during the
second influx from the south, and temples were erected to her worship
all over the volcanic districts of Hawaii. At that period <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>were
also introduced <i lang="haw">Laamaomao</i>, the god of the winds, the
poison goddesses <i lang="haw">Kalaipahoa</i> and <i lang=
"haw">Kapo</i>, and many other deities.</p>
<p>But the worship of the Hawaiians was not confined to <i lang=
"haw">Kane</i>, <i lang="haw">Ku</i>, <i lang="haw">Lono</i> and
<i lang="haw">Pele</i>. <i lang="haw">Heiaus</i> were erected to the
war-gods of the kings, and great sacrifices were frequently made to
them, generally of human beings, preceding, during, and following
campaigns and battles. Humbler temples were also maintained to fish,
shark, lizard and other gods, where sacrifices of fish and fruits were
offered.</p>
<p>To the superstitious masses the land abounded in gnomes and fairies,
and the waters in nymphs and monsters, whose caprices are themes of a
bountiful store of folk-lore. With almost every stream, gorge and
headland is connected some supernatural story, and the bards and
musicians of old earned an easy support by keeping alive these legends
of the people. To some supernatural powers were given, and malignant
and beneficent spirits assumed human forms and flitted among the palms
in the guise of birds.</p>

</div>
<p>The people made their own household gods, and destroyed them when
they failed to contribute to their success. For example, at Ninole, on
the southeast coast of Hawaii, is a small beach called Kaloa, the
stones of which, it was thought, propagated by contact with each other.
From the large stones the people made gods to preside over their games.
When a stone was selected for a god it was taken to the <i lang=
"haw">heiau</i>, where certain ceremonies were performed over it. It
was then dressed and taken to witness some game or pastime. If the
owner was successful it was accepted as a god; if unsuccessful more
than once or twice, it was thrown away or wrought into an axe or adze.
Sometimes a stone of each sex was selected, wrapped in <i lang=
"haw">kapa</i>, and laid away. In time a small pebble was found with
them. It increased in size, and was finally taken to the <i lang=
"haw">heiau</i> and formally made into a god. Such is the story that is
still told.</p>
<p>The people believed that the spirits of the departed continued to
hover around their earthly homes, and the shades of their ancestors
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>were appealed to in prayer. The owl and a bird
called the <i lang="haw">alae</i> were regarded as gods, and scores of
other deities, controlling the elements or presiding over the several
industries and amusements of the masses, were recognized and placated
with sacrifices when in unfavorable moods. They had a god of the winds,
of the husbandman, the warrior, the canoe-maker, the <i lang=
"haw">hula</i> dancer, the distiller, the orator, the doctor and the
sorcerer, and many gods of the sailor and the fisherman.</p>
<p>The services of the high-priest did not extend to these popular
deities on any of the islands of the group. The <i lang=
"haw">heiaus</i> over which he presided were dedicated either to the
higher gods of the pantheon or to the war-god of the king or supreme
chief. He was next to the king in authority, and always of
distinguished blood. Surrounded by seers, prophets and assistants, and
claiming to hold direct intercourse with the gods, he was consulted on
all matters of state consequence, and the auguries of the temple were
always accepted with respect and confidence. The high-priest sometimes
had charge of the war-god of the king, and in such cases went with it
to the field of battle.</p>
<p>Hua, one of the ancient kings of Maui, defied the priesthood and
slew his high-priest. As a warning to ruling chiefs, the story of the
consequences of Hua&rsquo;s madness has come down with great
conciseness through the chroniclers of the priesthood. Hua&rsquo;s
kingdom became a desolation. Wherever he traveled all vegetation
perished, and he finally died of famine on Hawaii, and his bones were
left to whiten in the sun.</p>
<p>There were several classes of priests, or <i lang="haw">kahunas</i>,
beside those who were connected with the temples. They were seers,
doctors and dealers in enchantment, and subsisted by preying upon the
people through their superstitions. All physical illness was attributed
either to the anger of the gods, witchcraft, or the prayers of a
malignant <i lang="haw">kahuna</i>. The afflicted person usually sent
for a <i lang="haw">kahuna</i>, whose first business was to discover
the cause of the malady through incantation. This ascertained, an
effort was made to counteract the spells or prayers which were wearing
away the life of the patient, and sometimes with so great success that
the affliction was transferred to the party whose malice had invoked
it.</p>
<p>The belief that one person might be prayed to death by another was
universal with the ancient Hawaiians, and not a few <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>of the
race would turn pale to-day if told that one of priestly strain was
earnestly praying for his death. In praying a person to death it was
essential that the <i lang="haw">kahuna</i> should possess something
closely connected with the person of the victim&mdash;a lock of his
hair, a tooth, a nail-paring, or a small quantity of his spittle, for
example; hence the office of spittoon-bearer to the ancient kings was
entrusted only to chiefs of some rank, who might be expected to guard
with care the royal expectoration.</p>
<p>The belief was general that the spirits of the dead might be seen
and conversed with by the <i>kilos</i>, or sorcerers, and the spirits
of the living, it was claimed, were sometimes invoked from their
slumbering tabernacles by priests of exceptional sanctity. The spirit
of the dead was called <i lang="haw">unihipili</i>, while the
disembodied and visible spirit of a living person was known as <i lang=
"haw">kahoaka</i>.</p>
<p>Of all the deities <i lang="haw">Pele</i> was held in greatest dread
on the island of Hawaii, where volcanic irruptions were frequent. With
her five brothers and eight sisters&mdash;all representing different
elemental forces&mdash;she dwelt in state in the fiery abysses of the
volcanoes, moving from one to another at her pleasure, and visiting
with inundations of lava such districts as neglected to cast into the
craters proper offerings of meats and fruits, or angered her in other
respects. One of her forms was that of a beautiful woman, in which she
sometimes sought human society, and numerous legends of her affairs of
love have been preserved. She was regarded as the special friend of
Kamehameha I., and the suffocation of a portion of the army of Keoua,
near the crater of Kilauea, in 1791, was credited directly to her.</p>
<p>The last public recognition of the powers of <i lang="haw">Pele</i>
occurred as late as 1882 on the island of Hawaii. The village of Hilo
was threatened. A broad stream of lava from Mauna Loa, after a
devastating journey of twenty-five miles or more, reached a point in
its downward course within a mile or two of the bay of Hilo. Its
movement was slow, like that of all lava-streams some distance from
their source, but its steadily approaching line of fire rendered it
almost certain that the village, and perhaps the harbor, of Hilo would
be destroyed within a very few days. Trenches were digged, walls were
raised, and prayers were offered, but all to no purpose. Downward moved
the awful avalanche of fire.</p>
<p>Ruth, a surviving sister of the fourth and fifth Kamehamehas,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>was then living in Honolulu. She was a proud,
stern old chiefess, who thought too little of the whites to attempt to
acquire their language. The danger threatening Hilo was reported to
her. &ldquo;I will save the fish-ponds of Hilo,&rdquo; said the old
chiefess. &ldquo;<i lang="haw">Pele</i> will not refuse to listen to
the prayer of a Kamehameha.&rdquo; She chartered a steamer, left
Honolulu for Hilo with a large number of attendants, and the next day
stood facing the still moving flow of lava. Ascending an elevation
immediately back of the village, she caused to be erected there a rude
altar, before which she made her supplications to <i lang=
"haw">Pele</i>, with offerings fed to the front of the advancing lava.
This done, she descended the hill with confidence and returned to
Honolulu.</p>
<p>The stream of fire ceased to move, and to-day its glistening front
stands like a wall around Hilo. &ldquo;A remarkable coincidence,&rdquo;
explained the whites. &ldquo;The work of <i lang="haw">Pele</i>,&rdquo;
whispered the natives, although the last of the temples of that goddess
had been destroyed sixty years before. Without discussing the
cause&mdash;a natural one beyond a doubt&mdash;it may be remarked that
the result has been something of a renewal with the natives of faith in
the discarded gods of their fathers.</p>
<p>All of the minor gods of the Hawaiians seem to have been independent
and self-controlling. It is not claimed that they derived their powers
from, were directed by, or were responsible to the supreme godhead.
Hence the mythology of the Polynesians, strong though it be in
individual powers and personations of the forces and achievements of
nature, presents itself to us in a fragmentary form, like an
incongruous patchwork of two or more half-developed or half-forgotten
religious systems.</p>
<div class="figure floatRight p043width" id="p043"><img src=
"images/p043.png" alt="Kalaipahoa, Poison War-Goddess of Molokai."
width="211" height="287">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Kalaipahoa, Poison War-Goddess
of Molokai.</span></p>
</div>
<p>One of the most noted of the independent deities of the group was
<i lang="haw">Kalaipahoa</i>, the poison-goddess of Molokai. Some
centuries back she came to the islands, with two or three of her
sisters, from an unknown land, and left her mark in many localities.
She entered a grove of trees on the island of Molokai, and left in them
a poison so intense that birds fell dead in flying over their branches.
The king of the island <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44"
name="pb44">44</a>]</span>was advised by his high-priest to have a god
hewn from one of the poisoned trees. Hundreds of his subjects perished
in the undertaking, but the image was finally finished and presented to
the king, wrapped in many folds of <i lang="haw">kapa</i>. It came down
the generations an object of fear, and was finally seized by the first
Kamehameha, and at his death divided among his principal chiefs.</p>
<p><i lang="haw">Kuula</i> was the principal god of the fishermen on
all the islands of the group. Rude temples were erected to him on the
shores of favorite fishing-grounds, and the first fish of every catch
was his due. His wife was <i lang="haw">Hina</i>, and she was appealed
to when her husband withheld his favors. <i lang="haw">Laeapua</i> and
<i lang="haw">Kaneapua</i> were gods worshipped by the fishermen of
Lanai, and other fish-gods were elsewhere recognized.</p>
<p>There were a number of shark and lizard gods. They were powerful and
malignant, and greatly feared by the classes who frequented the sea.
<i lang="haw">Heiaus</i> were erected to them on promontories
overlooking the ocean, and the offerings to them of fish and fruits
were always liberal. They assumed the forms of gigantic sharks and
lizards, and not unfrequently lashed the waters into fury and destroyed
canoes. <i lang="haw">Moaalii</i> was the great shark-god of Molokai
and Oahu. <i lang="haw">Apukohai</i> and <i lang="haw">Uhumakaikai</i>
were the evil gods infesting the waters of Kauai. <i lang=
"haw">Lonoakihi</i> was the eel-god of all the islands, and <i lang=
"haw">Ukanipo</i> was the shark-god of Hawaii.</p>
<p>Among the celebrated war-gods of the kings of the group was that of
Kamehameha I. It was called <i lang="haw">Kaili</i>, or <i lang=
"haw">Ku-kaili-moku</i>, and accompanied the great chief in all of his
important battles. It had been the war-god of the Hawaiian kings for
many generations, and was given in charge of Kamehameha by his royal
uncle, Kalauiopuu. It was a small wooden image, roughly carved, and
adorned with a head-dress of yellow feathers. It is said that at times,
in the heat of battle, it uttered cries which were heard above the
clash of arms. It is not known what became of the image after the death
of Kamehameha.</p>
<p>The public <i lang="haw">heiaus</i>, or temples, of the Hawaiians
were usually walled enclosures of from one to five acres, and generally
irregular in form. The walls were frequently ten feet in thickness and
twenty feet in height, and the material used, was unhewn <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>stone,
without mortar or cement. They narrowed slightly from the base upward,
and were sometimes capped with hewn slabs of coral or other rock not
too firm in texture to be worked with tools of stone.</p>
<p>Within this enclosure was an inner stone or wooden temple of small
dimensions, called the <i lang="haw">luakina</i>, or house of
sacrifice, and in front of the entrance to it stood the <i lang=
"haw">lele</i>, or altar, consisting of a raised platform of stone. The
inner temple was sacred to the priests. Within it stood the <i lang=
"haw">anu</i>, a small wicker enclosure, from which issued the oracles
of the <i lang="haw">kaulas</i>, or prophets, and around the walls were
ranged charms and gods of especial sanctity. Beside the entrance to
this sacred apartment were images of the principal gods, and the outer
and inner walls were surmounted by lines of stone and wooden idols.</p>
<p>The enclosure contained other buildings for the accommodation of the
high-priest and his assistants; also a house for the governing chief or
king, some distance removed from the domiciles of the priest. It was
used temporarily by him when on a visit of consultation to the temple,
or as a place of refuge in a time of danger. On each side of the
entrance to the outer enclosure was a <i lang="haw">tabu</i> staff, or
elevated cross, and near it was a small walled structure in which were
slain the victims for the altar.</p>
<p>When an augury was required by the king he frequently visited the
<i lang="haw">heiau</i> in person and propounded his questions to the
<i lang="haw">kaulas</i>. If the answers from the anu were vague and
unsatisfactory, other methods of divination were resorted to, such as
the opening of pigs and fowls, the shapes of the clouds, the flights of
birds, etc. After prayers by the priest the animals were killed, and
auguries were gathered from the manner in which they expired, the
appearance of the intestines&mdash;which were supposed to be the seat
of thought&mdash;and other signs. Sometimes the spleens of swine were
removed, if auguries of war were required, and held above the heads of
the priests while prayers were offered.</p>
<p>Before engaging in war or any other important enterprise attended by
doubt or danger, human and other sacrifices were made, of which there
were fifteen different kinds, and the first prisoners taken in battle
were reserved for the altar. The priests named the number of men
required for sacrifice, and the king <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>provided them, sometimes
from prisoners and malefactors, and sometimes from promiscuous drafts
along the highways. The victims were slain with clubs without the
temple walls, and their bodies, with other offerings, were laid upon
the altar to decay. When the king or other high chief made a special
offering of an enemy, the left eye of the victim, after the body had
been brought to the altar, was removed and handed to him by the
officiating priest. After making a semblance of eating it the chief
tossed it upon the altar.</p>
<p>During the construction of <i lang="haw">heiaus</i> human sacrifices
were usually offered as the work progressed, and when completed they
were dedicated with great pomp and solemnity, and the altars were
sometimes heaped with human bodies. In dedicating ordinary temples the
<i lang="haw">kaiopokeo</i> prayer was employed; but in consecrating
<i lang="haw">heiaus</i> of the first class the <i lang=
"haw">kuawili</i> invocation was recited, a prayer continuing from
sunrise to sunset. Oil and holy water were sprinkled upon the altars
and sacred vessels, and the services were under the direction of the
high-priest, and generally in the presence of the governing chief.</p>
<p>The ordinary services in the temples consisted of offerings of
fruits and meats, and of chants, prayers and responses, in which the
people sometimes joined. Women did not participate in the ceremonies of
the temples, but the exclusion found ample compensation in their
exemption from sacrifice when human bodies were required.</p>
<p>Temples of refuge, called <i lang="haw">puhonuas</i>, were
maintained on Hawaii, and possibly on Lanai and Oahu in the remote
past; but concerning the latter there is some doubt. One of the
<i lang="haw">puhonuas</i> on Hawaii was at Honaunau, near the sacred
burial-place of <i lang="haw">Hale-o-Keawe</i>, and the other at
Waipio, connected with the great <i lang="haw">heiau</i> of <i lang=
"haw">Paa-kalani</i>. Their gates were always open, and priests guarded
their entrances. Any one who entered their enclosures for protection,
whether chief or slave, whether escaping criminal or warrior in
retreat, was safe from molestation, even though the king pursued. These
places of refuge, with the right of circumcision, which existed until
after the death of the first Kamehameha, suggest a Polynesian contact
with the descendants of Abraham far back in the past, if not a kinship
with one of the scattered tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>In further evidence of the wanderings of the early Polynesians
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>in western and southern Asia, and of their
intercourse with the continental races, it may be mentioned that a
disposition toward phallic worship, attested by tradition and existing
symbols, followed them far out into the Pacific; and that connected
with their story of the creation, so closely resembling the Hebrew
version, is the Buddhist claim of previous creations which either ran
their course or were destroyed by an offended godhead. Nor is Hawaiian
tradition content with the mere advancement of the theory of successive
creations. It makes specific reference to a creation next preceding
that of their <i lang="haw">Ku-mu-honua</i>, or Adam, and gives the
names of the man and woman created and destroyed. They were <i lang=
"haw">Wela-ahi-lani</i> and <i lang="haw">Owe</i>.</p>
<p>It has been mentioned that the birds <i lang="haw">pueo</i> and
<i lang="haw">alae</i> were sacred and sometimes worshipped. Among the
sacred fish were the <i lang="haw">aku</i> and <i lang="haw">opelu</i>.
How they became so is told in a legend relating to the high-priest
Paao, who migrated to the islands in the eleventh century and induced
Pili to follow him. Before visiting Hawaii, Paao lived near his
brother, probably on the island of Samoa. Both were priests and well
skilled in sorcery and divination. The name of the brother was
Lonopele. Both were affluent and greatly respected. Lonopele&rsquo;s
lands were near the sea and produced the choicest varieties of fruits.
One season, when the fruits were ripening, Lonopele discovered that
some one was surreptitiously gathering them in the night-time, and
accused one of the sons of Paao of stealing them. Indignant at the
charge, and discerning no better way of disproving it, Paao killed and
opened his son, and showed his brother that there was no fruit in the
stomach of the boy.</p>
<p>Grieved at the death of his son, and holding his brother accountable
for it, Paao concluded to emigrate to some other land, and built strong
canoes for that purpose. About the time they were completed a son of
Lonopele chanced to be in the neighborhood, and Paao, remembering the
death of his own son, ordered the boy to be killed. He was missed, and
search was made for him, and his body was finally found near
Paao&rsquo;s canoes. Lonopele charged his brother with the murder. Paao
did not deny it, and Lonopele ordered him to leave the island. To avoid
further trouble Paao set sail at once with a party consisting of
thirty-eight persons. One tradition says Pili was of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>party;
but he must have left Samoa some years later, as Paao sent or went for
him after reaching Hawaii.</p>

<p class="figureHead">General Dominis, Consort of the
Heir-Apparent.</p>
</div>
<p>As the canoes were moving from the shore several prophets, standing
on the cliffs above, expressed a desire to join the party. &ldquo;Very
well,&rdquo; was the answer of Paao; &ldquo;if you are prophets, as you
say, leap from the cliffs and I will take you aboard.&rdquo; Several
leaped into the sea and were dashed against the rocks and drowned.
Finally Makuakaumana, a prophet of genuine inspiration, who was to have
accompanied the expedition, reached the shore and discovered the canoes
of Paao far out on the ocean. Raising his voice, he hailed Paao and
asked that a canoe might be sent back for him. &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo;
returned the priest in a loud voice, which the favoring winds bore to
the belated prophet. &ldquo;To return would be an omen of evil. There
is room for you, but if you would go with us you must fly to our
canoes.&rdquo; And, flying, the prophet reached the canoes in
safety.</p>
<p>Observing the canoes of Paao as they were disappearing in the
distance, Lonopele sent a violent storm to destroy them; but the strong
fish <i lang="haw">Aku</i> assisted in propelling the canoes against
the storm, and the mighty fish <i lang="haw">Opelu</i> swam around them
and broke the waves with his body. The malignant brother then sent the
great bird <i lang="haw">Kihahakaiwainapali</i> to vomit over the
canoes and sink them; but they were hastily covered with mats, and thus
escaped destruction. After a long voyage Paao landed in Puna, on the
coast of Hawaii. Thenceforth the <i lang="haw">aku</i> and <i lang=
"haw">opelu</i> were held sacred by Paao and his descendants.</p>

<h3 class="main">ANCIENT HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Previous to the eleventh century the several habitable
islands of the Hawaiian group were governed by one or more independent
chiefs, as already stated. After the migratory influx of that period,
however, and the settlement on the islands of a number of warlike
southern chiefs and their followers, the independent chiefs began to
unite for mutual protection. This involved the necessity of a supreme
head, which was usually found in the chief conceded to be the most
powerful; and thus <i lang="haw">alii-nuis</i>, <i lang="haw">mois</i>
and kings sprang into existence. So far as tradition extends, however,
certain lines, such as the Maweke, Pili and Paumakua families, were
always considered to be of supreme blood. They came to the islands as
chiefs of distinguished lineage, and so remained.</p>
<p>Gradually the powers of the <i lang="haw">mois</i> and ruling chiefs
were enlarged, until at length they claimed almost everything. Then the
chiefs held their possessions in fief to the <i lang="haw">moi</i>, and
forfeited them by rebellion. In time the king became absolute master of
the most of the soil over which he ruled, and assumed <i lang=
"haw">tabu</i> rights which rendered his person sacred and his
prerogatives more secure. All he acquired by conquest was his, and by
partitioning the lands among his titled friends he secured the support
necessary to his maintenance in power. Certain lands were inalienable
both in chiefly families and the priesthood; they were made so by early
sovereign decrees, which continued to be respected; but with each
succeeding king important land changes usually occurred.</p>
<p>Although the king maintained fish-ponds and cultivated lands of his
own, he was largely supported by his subject chiefs. They were expected
to contribute to him whatever was demanded either of food, raiment,
houses, canoes, weapons or labor, and in turn they took such portions
of the products of their tenants as their necessities required. The
<i lang="haw">ili</i> was the smallest political division; next above
it was the <i lang="haw">ahapuaa</i>, which paid a nominal or special
tax of one hog monthly to the king; next the <i lang="haw">okana</i>,
embracing several <i lang="haw">ahapuaas</i>; and finally the <i lang=
"haw">moku</i>, or district, or island.</p>
<p>The laboring classes possessed no realty of their own, nor could
they anywhere escape the claim or jurisdiction of a chief <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>or
landlord. They owed military and other personal service to their
respective chiefs, and the chiefs owed theirs to the king. If required,
all were expected to respond to a call to the field, fully armed and
prepared for battle.</p>
<p>Caste rules of dress, ornamentation and social forms were rigidly
enforced. The entire people were divided into four general classes:
first, the <i lang="haw">alii</i>, or chiefly families, of various
grades and prerogatives; second, the <i lang="haw">kahunas</i>,
embracing priests, prophets, doctors, diviners and astrologers; third,
the <i lang="haw">kanaka-wale</i>, or free private citizens; and,
fourth, the <i lang="haw">kauwa-maoli</i>, or slaves, either captured
in war or born of slave parents.</p>
<p>The laws were few and simple, and the most of them referred to the
rights and prerogatives of the king, priesthood and nobility. Property
disputes of the masses were settled by their chiefs, and other
grievances were in most instances left to private redress, which
frequently and very naturally resulted in prolonged and fatal family
feuds, in the end requiring chiefly and sometimes royal
intervention.</p>
<p>This, in brief and very general terms, was the prevailing character
of the government and land tenure throughout the several islands of the
group until after the death of Kamehameha I. in 1819, and the
relinquishment by the crown of its ancient and sovereign rights in the
soil.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Meeting Place of an Ancient Secret Society.</p>
<p class="first">(FROM A PAINTING IN THE ROYAL PALACE.)</p>
</div>
<p>The leading chiefs and high-priesthood claimed a lineage distinct
from that of the masses, and traced their ancestry back to <i lang=
"haw">Kumuhonua</i>, the Polynesian Adam. The <i lang=
"haw">iku-pau</i>, a sacred class of the supreme priesthood, assumed to
be the direct descendants from the godhead, while the <i lang=
"haw">iku-nuu</i> were a collateral branch of the sacred and royal
strain, and possessed only temporal powers. It was thus that one of the
families of the Hawaiian priesthood, in charge of the verbal
genealogical records, exalted itself in sanctity above the political
rulers.</p>
<p>Proud of their lineage, to guard against imposture and keep their
blood uncorrupted, the chiefs allowed their claims to family
distinction to be passed upon by a college of heraldry, established by
an early <i lang="haw">moi</i> of Maui. Reciting their genealogies
before the college, composed of <i lang="haw">aliis</i> of accepted
rank, and receiving the recognition of the council, chiefs were then
regarded as members of the grade of <i lang="haw">aha-alii</i>, or
chiefs of admitted and irrevocable rank. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>The chiefs inherited their titles and <i lang="haw">tabu</i>
privileges quite as frequently through the rank of one parent as of the
other. As Hawaiian women of distinction usually had more than one
husband, and the chiefs were seldom content with a single wife, the
difficulty of determining the rights and ranks of their children was by
no means easy; but the averment of the mother was generally accepted as
conclusive and sufficient evidence in that regard.</p>
<p>For political purposes marriage alliances were common between the
royal and chiefly families of the several islands, and thus in time the
superior nobility of the entire group became connected by ties of
blood. The political or principal wife of a king or distinguished chief
was usually of a rank equal to that of her husband, and their marriage
was proclaimed by heralds and celebrated with befitting ceremonies.
Other wives were taken by simple agreement, and without ceremony or
public announcement. Very much in the same manner the masses entered
into their marriage unions. With the latter, however, polygamy was not
common. When husband and wife separated, as they frequently did, each
was at liberty to select another partner. The political wife of a chief
was called <i lang="haw">wahine-hoao</i>; the others, <i lang=
"haw">haia-wahine</i>, or concubine.</p>
<p>In the royal families, to subserve purposes of state, father and
daughter, brother and sister, and uncle and niece frequently united as
man and wife. The children of such unions were esteemed of the highest
rank, and, strange to say, no mental or physical deterioration seemed
to result from these incestuous relations, for all through the past the
<i lang="haw">mois</i> and nobles of the group were noted for their
gigantic proportions.</p>
<p>There were five or more grades of chiefs connected with the royal
lines. First in order, and the most sacred, was the <i lang=
"haw">alii-niaupio</i> (the offspring of a prince with his own sister);
next, the <i lang="haw">alii-pio</i> (the offspring of a prince with
his own niece); next, the <i lang="haw">alii-naha</i> (the offspring of
a prince or king with his own daughter); next, the <i lang=
"haw">alii-wohi</i> (the offspring of either of the foregoing with
another chiefly branch); and next, the <i lang="haw">lo-alii</i>
(chiefs of royal blood). Any of these might be either male or
female.</p>
<p>To these grades of chiefs distinct personal <i>tabus</i> or
prerogatives were attached, such as the <i lang="haw">tabu-moe</i>,
<i lang="haw">tabu-wela</i>, <i lang="haw">tabu-hoano</i> and <i lang=
"haw">tabu-wohi</i>. These <i>tabus</i> could be given or bequeathed to
others <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>by their possessors, but could not be multiplied
by transmission. The <i lang="haw">meles</i>, or ancestral chants of a
family, passed in succession to the legal representatives, and became
exclusively theirs; but the government, <i>tabus</i> and household gods
of the king were subject to his disposal as he willed, either at his
death or before it. The child of a <i>tabu</i> chief, born of a mother
of lower rank, could not, according to custom, assume the <i>tabu</i>
privileges of his father, although in some instances in the past they
were made to inure to such offspring, notably in the case of Umi, King
of Hawaii.</p>
<p>Before an <i lang="haw">alii-niaupio</i>, clothed with the supreme
function of the <i lang="haw">tabu-moe</i>, all, with the exception of
<i lang="haw">tabu</i> chiefs, were compelled to prostrate themselves.
When he appeared or was approached his rank was announced by an
attendant, and all not exempt from the homage were required to drop
with their faces to the earth. The exemptions were the <i lang=
"haw">alii-pio</i>, the <i lang="haw">alii-naha</i>, the <i lang=
"haw">alii-wohi</i> and the <i lang="haw">lo-alii</i>. They, and they
alone, were permitted to stand in the presence of a <i lang=
"haw">niaupio</i> chief. An <i lang="haw">alii-pio</i> was also a
sacred chief, so much so that he conversed with others only in the
night-time, and on chiefesses of that rank the sun was not allowed to
shine.</p>
<p>The kings lived in affluence in large mansions of wood or stone, in
the midst of walled grounds adorned with fruit and shade trees and
other attractive forms of vegetation. The grounds also contained many
other smaller buildings for the accommodation of guests, retainers,
attendants, servants and guards. They were attended by their
high-priests, civil and military advisers, and a retinue of favorite
chiefs, and spent their time, when not employed in war or affairs of
state, in indolent and dignified repose.</p>
<p>The personal attendants of an ancient Hawaiian king were all of
noble blood, and each had his specified duty. They were known as
<i lang="haw">kahu-alii</i>, or guardians of the person of the king.
They consisted of the <i lang="haw">iwikuamoo</i>, or rubber of the
person; the <i lang="haw">ipukuha</i>, or spittoon-bearer; the <i lang=
"haw">paakahili</i>, or <i lang="haw">kahili</i>-bearer; the <i lang=
"haw">kiaipoo</i>, or sleep-watcher; and the <i lang=
"haw">aipuupuu</i>, or steward. Other inferior chiefs, called <i lang=
"haw">puuku</i>, with messengers, spies, executioners, prophets,
astrologers, poets, historians, musicians and dancers, were among his
retainers. Connected with the palace was an apartment used as a
<i lang="haw">heiau</i>, or chapel, which was sometimes in charge of
the high-priest. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span></p>
<p>During festival seasons brilliant feasts, tournaments and <i lang=
"haw">hula</i> and musical entertainments were given in the royal
grounds, and the court was splendid in displays of flowers, feathers
and other gaudy trappings. The king not unfrequently took part in the
manly games and exercises of the chiefs, and sometimes complimented the
<i lang="haw">hula</i> dancers and musicians by joining in their
performances.</p>
<p>To render the kings and higher nobility still more exclusive, they
had a court language which was understood only by themselves, and which
was changed in part from time to time as its expressions found
interpretation beyond the royal circle. Some portions of this court
language have been preserved.</p>

<h3 class="main">ARTS, HABITS AND CUSTOMS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All implements of war or industry known to the early
Hawaiians were made either of wood, stone, or bone, as the islands are
destitute of metals; but with these rude helps they laid up hewn-stone
walls, felled trees, made canoes and barges, manufactured cloths and
cordage, fashioned weapons, constructed dwellings and temples, roads
and fish-ponds, and tilled the soil. They had axes, adzes and hammers
of stone, spades of wood, knives of flint and ivory, needles of thorn
and bone, and spears and daggers of hardened wood. They wove mats for
sails and other purposes, and from the inner bark of the paper
mulberry-tree beat out a fine, thin cloth called <i lang=
"haw">kapa</i>, which they ornamented with colors and figures.</p>
<p>Their food was the flesh of swine, dogs and fowls; fish, and almost
everything living in the sea; <i lang="haw">taro</i>, sweet potatoes
and yams, and fruits, berries and edible sea-weed of various kinds.
<i lang="haw">Poi</i>, the favorite food of all classes, was a slightly
fermented paste made of cooked and pounded <i lang="haw">taro</i>, a
large bulbous root, in taste resembling an Indian turnip. They made a
stupefying beverage by chewing the <i lang="haw">awa</i> root, and from
the sweet root of the <i lang="haw">ti</i> plant fermented an
intoxicating drink. The soft parts of the sugar-cane were eaten, but,
with the exception of the manufacture of a beer called <i lang=
"haw">uiuia</i>, no other use seems to have been made of it. Their
food, wrapped in <i lang="haw">ti</i> leaves, was usually cooked in
heated and covered pits in the earth. Their household vessels were
shells, gourd calabashes of various shapes and sizes, and platters and
other containers made of wood. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56"
href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>The dress of the ancient Hawaiian was scant, simple and cool. The
principal, and generally the only, garment of the male was the maro, a
narrow cloth fastened around the loins. To this was sometimes added,
among the masses, a <i lang="haw">kihei</i>, or cloth thrown loosely
over the shoulders. The females wore a <i lang="haw">pau</i>, or skirt
of invariably five thicknesses of <i lang="haw">kapa</i>, fastened
around the waist and extending to the knees. When the weather was cool
a short mantle was sometimes added. Ordinarily the heads of both sexes
were without coverings, and in rare instances they wore <i lang=
"haw">kamaas</i>, or sandals of <i lang="haw">ti</i> or pandanus
leaves.</p>
<p>With the <i lang="haw">maro</i>, which was common to the males of
all ranks, the king on state occasions wore the royal <i lang=
"haw">mamo</i>, a mantle reaching to the ankles, and made of the yellow
feathers of a little sea-bird called the <i lang="haw">mamo</i>. When
it is mentioned that but a single yellow feather is found under each
wing of the <i lang="haw">mamo</i>, and that tens of thousands,
perhaps, entered into the fabrication of a single mantle, some idea of
the value of such a garment may be gathered. A few of these royal
cloaks are still in existence, one of which was worn by King Kalakaua
during the ceremonies of his late coronation. Pure yellow was the royal
color. The shorter capes or mantles of the chiefs were of yellow
feathers mixed with red. The color of the priests and gods was red.</p>

<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Palaoa, a Talisman worn around

</div>
<p>The ornaments of the nobility consisted of head-dresses of feathers,
<i lang="haw">palaoas</i>, or charms of bone suspended from the neck,
and necklaces and bracelets of shells, teeth and other materials. Many
of them were tattooed on the face, thighs and breast, but the practice
was not universal. Flowers were in general use as ornaments, and at
feasts, festivals and other gatherings garlands of fragrant leaves and
blossoms crowned the heads and encircled the necks of all. This is
among the beautiful customs still retained by the Hawaiians.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>The dwellings of the masses were constructed of upright posts
planted in the ground, with cross-beams and rafters, and roofs and
sides of woven twigs and branches thatched with leaves. The houses of
the nobility were larger, stronger and more pretentious, and were
frequently surrounded by broad verandas. It was a custom to locate
dwellings so that the main entrance would face the east, the home of
<i lang="haw">Kane</i>. The opposite entrance looked toward Kahiki, the
land from which Wakea came.</p>
<p>The homes of well-conditioned Hawaiians consisted of no less than
six separate dwellings or apartments: 1st, the <i lang="haw">heiau</i>,
or idol-house; 2d, the <i lang="haw">mua</i>, or eating-house of the
males, which females were not allowed to enter; 3d, the <i lang=
"haw">hale-noa</i>, or house of the women, which men could not enter;
4th, the <i lang="haw">hale-aina</i>, or eating-house of the wife; 5th,
the <i lang="haw">kua</i>, or wife&rsquo;s working-house; and 6th, the
<i lang="haw">hale-pea</i>, or retiring-house or nursery of the wife.
The poorer classes followed these regulations so far as their means
would admit, but screens usually took the place of separate dwellings
or definite apartments.</p>
<p>When war was declared or invasion threatened, messengers, called
<i lang="haw">lunapais</i>, were despatched by the king to his subject
chiefs, who promptly responded in warriors, canoes, or whatever else
was demanded. A regular line-of-battle consisted of a centre and right
and left wings, and marked military genius was sometimes displayed in
the handling of armies. Sea-battles, where hundreds, sometimes
thousands, of war-canoes met in hostile shock, were common, and usually
resulted in great loss of life. Truces and terms of peace were
ordinarily respected, but few prisoners were spared except for
sacrifice.</p>
<p>The weapons of the islanders were spears about twenty feet in
length, javelins, war-clubs, stone axes, rude halberds, knives, daggers
and slings. The slings were made either of cocoa fibre or human hair.
The stones thrown were sometimes a pound or more in weight, and were
delivered with great force and accuracy. The spears were sometimes
thrown, while the javelins were reserved for closer encounter. Shields
were unknown. Hostile missiles were either dodged, caught in the hands,
or dexterously warded. The chiefs frequently wore feather helmets in
battle, but the person was without protection.</p>

</div>
<p>The athletic sports and games of the people were numerous.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>The muscular pastimes consisted in part of
contests in running, jumping, boxing, wrestling, swimming, diving,
canoe-racing and surf-riding. Rolling round stone disks and throwing
darts along a prepared channel was a favorite sport; but the most
exciting was the <i lang="haw">holua</i> contest, in which two or more
might engage. On long, light and narrow sledges the contestants, lying
prone, dashed down long and steep declivities, the victory being with
the one who first reached the bottom. The goddess <i lang=
"haw">Pele</i> enjoyed the game, and frequently engaged in it. But she
was a dangerous contestant. On being beaten by Kahavari, a chief of
Puna, she drove him from the district with a stream of lava. Sham
battles and spear and stone throwing were also popular exercises.</p>
<p>Among the in-door games were <i lang="haw">konane</i>, <i lang=
"haw">kilu</i>, <i lang="haw">puhenehene</i>, <i lang=
"haw">punipiki</i>, and <i lang="haw">hiua</i>. <i lang=
"haw">Konane</i> resembled the English game of draughts. <i lang=
"haw">Puhenehene</i> consisted of the adroit hiding by one of the
players of a small object under one of several mats in the midst of the
party of contestants, and the designation of its place of concealment
by the others. <i lang="haw">Kilu</i> was a game somewhat similar,
accompanied by singing. <i lang="haw">Punipiki</i> was something like
the game of &ldquo;fox and geese,&rdquo; and <i lang="haw">hiua</i> was
played on a board with four squares. These were the most ancient of
Hawaiian household games.</p>
<div class="figure floatRight p058-2width" id="p058-2"><img src=
"images/p058-2.png" alt="Pahu, or Drum." width="194" height="299">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Pahu, or Drum.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The musical instruments of the islanders were few and simple. They
consisted of <i>pahus</i>, or drums, of various sizes; the ohe, a
bamboo flute; the <i lang="haw">hokio</i>, a rude clarionet; a nasal
flageolet, and a reed instrument played by the aid of the voice. To
these were added, on special occasions, castanets and dry gourds
containing pebbles, which were used to mark the time of chants and
other music. They had many varieties of dances, or <i>hulas</i>, all of
which were more or less graceful, and a few of which were coarse and
licentious. Bands of <i lang="haw">hula</i> dancers, male and female,
were among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>the retainers of the <i lang="haw">mois</i> and
prominent chiefs, and their services were required on every festive
occasion.</p>
<p>The mourning customs of the people were peculiar. For days they
wailed and feasted together over a dead relative or friend, frequently
knocking out one or more teeth, shaving portions of their heads and
beards, and tearing their flesh and clothes. But their wildest displays
of grief were on the death of their kings and governing chiefs. During
a royal mourning season, which sometimes continued for weeks, the
people indulged in an unrestrained saturnalia of recklessness and
license. Every law was openly violated, every conceivable crime
committed. The excuse was&mdash;and the authorities were compelled to
accept it&mdash;that grief had temporarily unseated the popular reason,
and they were not responsible for their misdemeanors.</p>
<p>The masses buried their dead or deposited the bodies in caves, but
the bones of the kings were otherwise disposed of. There were royal
burial-places&mdash;one at Honaunau, on the island of Hawaii, and
another, called Iao, on Maui&mdash;and the tombs of many of the ancient
<i lang="haw">mois</i> and ruling chiefs were in one or the other of
those sacred spots; but they probably contained but few royal bones. In
the fear that the bones of the <i lang="haw">mois</i> and distinguished
chiefs might fall into the hands of their enemies and be used for
fish-hooks, arrow-points for shooting mice, and other debasing
purposes, they were usually destroyed or hidden. Some were weighted and
thrown into the sea, and others, after the flesh had been removed from
them and burned, were secreted in mountain caves. The hearts of the
kings of the island of Hawaii were frequently thrown into the crater of
Kilauea as an offering to <i lang="haw">Pele</i>. The bones of the
first Kamehameha were so well secreted in some cave in Kona that they
have not yet been found, and the bones of Kualii, a celebrated Oahuan
king of the seventeenth century, were reduced to powder, mingled with
<i lang="haw">poi</i>, and at the funeral feast fed to a hundred
unsuspecting chiefs.</p>

<p>The ancient Hawaiians divided the year into twelve months of thirty
days each. The days of the month were named, not numbered. As this gave
but three hundred and sixty days to their year, they added and gave to
their god <i lang="haw">Lono</i> in feasting and festivity the number
of days required to complete the sidereal year, which was regulated by
the rising of the Pleiades. The new <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61"
href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>year began with the winter
solstice. They also reckoned by lunar months in the regulation of their
monthly feasts. The year was divided into two seasons&mdash;the rainy
and the dry&mdash;and the day into three general parts, morning, noon
and night. The first, middle and after parts of the night were also
designated.</p>
<p>As elsewhere mentioned, they had names for the five principal
planets, which they called &ldquo;the wandering stars,&rdquo; and for a
number of heavenly groups and constellations. It was this knowledge of
the heavens that enabled them to navigate the ocean in their frail
canoes.</p>
<p>In counting, the Hawaiians reckoned by fours and their multiples.
Their highest expressed number was four hundred thousand. More than
that was indefinite.</p>
<p>After what has been written it would seem scarcely necessary to
mention that the Hawaiians were not cannibals. Their legends refer to
two or three instances of cannibalism on the islands, but the
man-eaters were natives of some other group and did not long
survive.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE HAWAII OF TO-DAY.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With this somewhat extended reference to the past of
the Hawaiian Islands and their people, it is deemed that a brief
allusion to their present political, social, industrial and commercial
condition will not be out of place. The legends presented leave the
simple but warlike islanders standing naked but not ashamed in the
light of civilization suddenly flashed upon them from across the seas.
In the darkness behind them are legends and spears; in the light before
them are history and law. Let us see what the years since have done for
them.</p>
<p>The Hawaiian government of to-day is a mild constitutional monarchy,
the ruling family claiming descent from the most ancient and respected
of the chiefly blood of Hawaii. The departments of the government are
legislative, executive and judicial.</p>
<p>The Legislative Assembly, which meets every two years, consists of
representatives chosen by the people, nobles named by the sovereign,
and crown ministers. They act in a single body, choosing their
presiding officer by ballot, and their proceedings are held jointly in
the English and Hawaiian languages, and in both are their laws and
proceedings published. As the elective franchise is confined to native
and naturalized citizens, the most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62"
href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>of the representatives chosen by
the people are natives, all of whom are more or less educated, and many
of whom are graceful and eloquent debaters. White representatives of
accepted sympathy with the natives are occasionally elected, and a
majority of the nobles and ministers are white men. The English common
law is the basis of their statutes, and their civil and criminal codes
are not unlike our own. The Legislature fixes tax, excise and customs
charges, and provides by appropriation for all public expenditure. The
representatives are paid small salaries, and the Legislature is
formally convened and prorogued by the king in person.</p>
<p>Although the present sovereign was elected by the Legislature, for
the reason heretofore mentioned, the naming of a successor is left to
the occupant of the throne. The king is provided at public expense with
a palace and royal guard, and appropriations of money amounting to
perhaps forty thousand dollars yearly. He has also some additional
income from what are known as crown lands. The two sisters of the king
and the daughter of one of them receive from the treasury an aggregate
of fifteen thousand five hundred dollars yearly. The king entertains
liberally, is generous with his friends and attendants, and probably
finds his income no more than sufficient to meet his wants from year to
year. His advisers are four Ministers of State and a Privy Council. The
Ministry is composed of a Minister of Foreign Affairs, who ranks as
premier, Minister of Finance, Minister of Interior, and
Attorney-General. The Privy Council is composed of thirty or forty
leading citizens appointed by the Crown. In certain matters they have
original and exclusive powers. They are convened in council from time
to time, but receive no compensation. The most of the Privy Councillors
are white men, and embrace almost every nationality. The majority of
the ministers of state are usually white men of ability, and their
salaries are six thousand dollars per annum each.</p>
<p>The judiciary is composed of a Supreme Court of three members, one
of whom is chief-justice and chancellor, Circuit Courts holden in
different districts, and minor magistrates&rsquo; courts in localities
where they are required. The Supreme and Circuit judges are all white
men, and but few magistrates are natives. The salaries of the superior
judges are respectable, and the most of them are men of ability. The
laws, as a rule, are intelligently <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63"
href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>administered and promptly
executed, and life and property are amply protected.</p>
<p>Public schools are numerous throughout the islands, and are largely
attended by native children. A considerable proportion of the adult
natives are able to read and write their own language, and a number of
native newspapers and periodicals are sustained. The English press of
Honolulu&mdash;the only point of publication&mdash;is respectable in
ability and enterprise.</p>
<p>Leprosy was brought to the islands by the Chinese about forty years
ago, and has become a dangerous and loathsome scourge. Lepers are
seldom encountered, however, as they are removed, whenever discovered,
to the island of Molokai, where they are humanely cared for by the
government. It is a cureless but painless affliction, and is doubtless
contagious under certain conditions. Nine-tenths or more of the lepers
are either natives or Chinese, and the whole number amounts to perhaps
twelve hundred. It is not thought that the malady is increasing, and it
is hoped that a careful segregation of the afflicted will in time
eradicate the disease from the group.</p>
<p>The commerce of the islands is largely in the hands of foreigners,
and the sugar plantations are almost exclusively under their control.
There are but few native merchants, the large dealers being Americans,
Germans, English and French, while the smaller traders are generally
Portuguese and Chinese. There are native lawyers, clerks, mechanics,
magistrates and police-men; but the most of the race who are compelled
to labor for their support find employment as farm and plantation
laborers, stevedores, sailors, coachmen, boatmen, fishermen, gardeners,
fruit-pedlars, waiters, soldiers and house-servants, in all of which
capacities they are generally industrious, cheerful and honest.</p>
<p>The products of the islands for export are sugar, molasses, rice,
bananas, fungus, hides and wool, of an aggregate approximate value of
eight million dollars annually. The principal product, however, is
sugar, amounting to perhaps one hundred thousand tons yearly.
Nine-tenths of the exports of the group find a market in the United
States, and four-fifths or more of the imports in value are from the
great Republic. The receipts and expenditures of the government are a
little less than one million five hundred thousand dollars annually,
derived principally from customs duties and direct taxation.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p>The population of the islands is a little more than eighty thousand,
of which about forty-five thousand are natives. The Americans, English,
Germans, Norwegians and French number perhaps ten thousand, and
Chinese, Japanese and Portuguese from the Azores constitute the most of
the remainder.</p>
<p>The postal facilities of the islands are ample and reliable.
Inter-island steamers, of which there are many, convey the mails
throughout the group at regular intervals, and the San Franciscan and
Australian steamers afford a punctual and trustworthy service with the
rest of the world. The islands have a postal money-order system
reaching within and beyond their boundaries, and are connected with the
Universal Postal Union.</p>
<p>Over twenty thousand of the inhabitants of the group are centred in
Honolulu, the capital of the kingdom, and its beautiful and dreamy
suburb of Waikiki. The business portions of the city, with their
macadamized and lighted streets, and blocks of brick and stone
buildings, have a thrifty and permanent appearance, while the eastern
suburbs, approaching the hills with a gentle ascent, abound in charming
residences embowered in palms. Small mountain streams run through the
city and afford an abundant supply of sweet water, which is further
augmented by a number of flowing artesian wells. With a temperature
ranging from seventy to ninety degrees, Honolulu, with its substantial
churches and public buildings, its air of affluence and dreamy quiet,
is a delightful place of residence to those who enjoy the heat and
languor of the tropics.</p>
<p>In the midst of these evidences of prosperity and advancement it is
but too apparent that the natives are steadily decreasing in numbers
and gradually losing their hold upon the fair land of their fathers.
Within a century they have dwindled from four hundred thousand healthy
and happy children of nature, without care and without want, to a
little more than a tenth of that number of landless, hopeless victims
to the greed and vices of civilization. They are slowly sinking under
the restraints and burdens of their surroundings, and will in time
succumb to social and political conditions foreign to their natures and
poisonous to their blood. Year by year their footprints will grow more
dim along the sands of their reef-sheltered shores, and fainter and
fainter will come their simple songs from the shadows of the palms,
until finally their voices will be heard no more for ever. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>And
then, if not before&mdash;and no human effort can shape it
otherwise&mdash;the Hawaiian Islands, with the echoes of their songs
and the sweets of their green fields, will pass into the political, as
they are now firmly within the commercial, system of the great American
Republic.</p>

<p class="first">The story of the <i>Iliad</i> is a dramatic record of
the love and hate, wrong and revenge, courage and custom, passion and
superstition, of mythical Greece, and embraces in a single brilliant
recital events which the historic bards of other lands, lacking the
genius of Homer, have sent down the centuries in fragments. Human
nature has been substantially the same in all ages, differing only in
the ardor of its passions and appetites, as affected by the zone of its
habitat and its peculiar physical surroundings. Hence almost every
nation, barbarous and civilized, has had its Helen and its Troy, its
Paris and its Agamemnon, its Hector and its demi-gods; and Hawaii is
not an exception. The wrath of no dusky Achilles is made the thesis of
the story of the Hawaiian abduction, but in other respects the Greek
and Polynesian legends closely resemble each other in their general
outlines.</p>
<p>The story of Hina, the Hawaiian Helen, and Kaupeepee, the Paris of
the legend, takes us back to the twelfth century, near the close of the
second and final era of migration from Tahiti, Samoa, and perhaps other
islands of Polynesia&mdash;a period which added very considerably to
the population of the group, and gave to it many new chiefs, a number
of new customs, and a few new gods. That the tale may be better
understood by the reader who may not be conversant with the legendary
history of the Hawaiian Islands, it will be necessary to refer briefly
to the political and social condition of the group at that time.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the many sharply drawn and wonderfully-preserved
historic legends of the Hawaiians, the early settlement of the little
archipelago is shrouded in mystery. The best testimony, however,
warrants the assumption that the islands were first discovered and
occupied by a people who had drifted from southern Asia to the islands
of the Pacific in the first or second <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>century of the Christian
era, and, by migratory stages from the <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2789" title="Source: Figis">Fijis</span> to Samoa and thence to
Tahiti, had reached the Hawaiian group in about <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 550. The first discovery was doubtless the result of
accident; but those who made it were able to find their way back to the
place from which they started&mdash;either Tahiti or Samoa&mdash;and in
due time return with augmented numbers, bearing with them to their new
home pigs, fowls, dogs, and the seeds of such fruits and vegetables as
they had found to be wanting there.</p>
<p>The little colony grew and prospered, and for nearly five hundred
years had no communication with, or knowledge of, the world beyond. At
the end of that time their geographical traditions had grown so faint
that they spoke only of Kahiki, a place very far away, from which their
ancestors came. First landing on the large island of Hawaii, they had
spread over the eight habitable divisions of the group. The people were
ruled by district chiefs, in fief to a supreme head on some of the
islands, and on others independent, and the lines dividing the masses
from the nobility were less strictly drawn than during the centuries
succeeding. Wars were frequent between neighboring chiefs, and popular
increase was slow; but the <i>tabus</i> of the chiefs and priests were
not oppressive, and the people claimed and exercised a degree of
personal independence unknown to them after the eleventh century.</p>
<p>In about <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1025, or perhaps a little
earlier, the people of the group were suddenly aroused from their long
dream of six centuries by the arrival of a large party of adventurers
from Tahiti. Their chief was Nanamaoa. Their language resembled that of
the Hawaiians, and their customs and religions were not greatly at
variance. They were therefore received with kindness, and in a few
years their influence began to be felt throughout the group. They
landed at Kohala, Hawaii, and Nanamaoa soon succeeded in establishing
himself there as an influential chief. His sons secured possessions on
Maui and Oahu, and on the latter island one of
them&mdash;Nanakaoko&mdash;instituted the sacred place called
Kukaniloko, in the district of Ewa, where it was the desire of future
chiefs that their sons should be born. Even Kamehameha I., as late as
1797, sought to remove his queen thither before the birth of Liholiho,
but the illness of the royal mother prevented. This became the sacred
birth-place of princes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href=
"#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>as Iao, in Wailuku valley, on the
island of Maui, became their <i>tabu</i> spot of interment.</p>
<p>It was at Kukaniloko that Kapawa, the son of Nanakaoko, was born.
His principal seat of power was probably on Hawaii, although he
retained possessions on Maui and Oahu. It was during his life that the
celebrated chief and priest Paao made his appearance in the group. He
came from one of the southern islands with a small party, bringing with
him new gods and new modes of worship, and to him the subsequent
high-priests of Hawaii traced their sacerdotal line, even down to
Hevaheva, who in 1819 was the first to apply the torch to the temples
in which his ancestors had so long worshipped. Paao was a statesman and
warrior as well as a priest, but he preferred spiritual to temporal
authority; and when Kapawa died and was buried at Iao, leaving his
possessions without a competent ruler and his subjects in a state
bordering upon anarchy, Paao did not assume the chieftaincy, as he
manifestly might have done, but despatched messengers&mdash;if, indeed,
he did not go himself&mdash;to the land of his birth, to invite to
Hawaii a chief capable of restoring order.</p>
<p>Such a leader was found in Pilikaekae, of Samoa, who migrated to
Hawaii with a goodly number of retainers, and was promptly established
in the vacant sovereignty, while Paao continued in the position of
high-priest. Pili extended his authority over the six districts of
Hawaii; but beyond Kohala and the northern part of the island the
recognition of his sovereignty was merely nominal, and internal wars
and revolts were frequent.</p>
<p>The next arrivals of note from the southern islands were the two
Paumakua families, one of which settled in Oahu and Kauai and the other
in Hawaii and Maui. Whether, as averred by conflicting traditions, they
arrived contemporaneously or two or three generations apart, is a
question in nowise pertinent to our story. The legend is connected with
the Hawaii branch alone, and the order of their coming need not,
therefore, be here discussed.</p>
<p>The Paumakua family, which became so influential in Hawaii and Maui,
arrived during the early part of the reign of Pili, in about
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1090. A large party accompanied the
family, and they brought with them their gods, priests, astrologers and
prophets. They first landed and secured possessions in Maui;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>but the sons and other relatives of Paumakua were
brave and ambitious, and soon by conquest and marriage secured an
almost sovereign footing both in Maui and Hawaii.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Type of Ancient King in State.</p>
</div>
<p>One of the nephews of Paumakua, Hakalanileo, who was the son of
Kuheailani, as an entering wedge to further acquisitions became in some
manner possessed of a strip of land along the coast in the district of
Hilo, Hawaii. It was a large estate, and the owner availed himself of
every opportunity to extend its boundaries and increase the number of
his dependents. His wife was the beautiful Hina of Hawaiian song and
daughter of the seeress Uli, who had migrated from Tahiti with some one
of the several expeditions of that period&mdash;possibly with the
Paumakua family, although tradition does not so state.</p>
<p>At that time Kamauaua, a powerful chief of the ancient native line
of Nanaula, held sway over the island of Molokai. He proudly traced
back his ancestry to the first migration in the sixth century, and
regarded with aversion and well-founded alarm the new migratory tide
which for years past had been casting upon the shores of the islands a
flood of alien adventurers, whose warlike and aggressive chiefs were
steadily possessing themselves of the fairest portions of the group. He
had sought to form a league of native chiefs against these dangerous
encroachments; but the wily invaders, with new gods to awe the masses
and new customs and new traditions to charm the native nobility, had,
through intermarriage and strategy rather than force, become the
virtual rulers of Hawaii, Maui, Oahu, and Kauai, and he had abandoned
all hope of seeing them supplanted. Molokai alone remained exclusively
under native control, and its resolute old chief had from their infancy
instilled into his sons a hatred of the southern spoilers and a
resolution to resist their aggressions to the bitter end.</p>
<p>The eldest of the sons of Kamauaua was Kaupeepee. He was a warlike
youth, well skilled in arms and mighty in strength and courage, and so
profound was his detestation of the alien chiefs that he resolved to
devote his life to such warfare as he might be able to make upon them
and their subjects. With this view he relinquished his right of
succession to his first brother, Keoloewa, and, gathering around him a
band of warriors partaking of his desperation and courage, established
a stronghold on the promontory of Haupu, on the north side of the
island, between <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>Pelekunu and Waikolo. At that point, and for some
miles on each side of it, the mountains hug the ocean so closely as to
leave nothing between them and the surf-beaten shores but a succession
of steep, narrow and rugged promontories jutting out into the sea, and
separated from each other by gorge-like and gloomy little valleys
gashing the hills and, like dragons, for ever swallowing and ejecting
the waves that venture too near their rocky jaws.</p>
<p>One of the most rugged of these promontories was Haupu. It was a
natural fortress, precipitously fronting the sea with a height of five
hundred feet or more, and flanked on the right and left by almost
perpendicular declivities rising from narrow gulches choked with
vegetation and sweetening the sea with rivulets of fresh water dashing
down from the mountains seamed by their sources. It was connected with
the range of mountains back of it by a narrow and rising ridge, which
at a point something less than a mile inland, where opposite branches
of the two flanking gulches approached each other closely, was
contracted to a neck of not more than fifty paces in width. The summit
of the point abutting the ocean was a comparatively level plateau, or
rather series of three connecting terraces, embracing in all an area of
nearly a hundred acres. Surrounded on three sides by almost
perpendicular walls, and accessible on the fourth only by a narrow and
easily-defended ridge extending to the mountains, little engineering
skill was required to render the place well-nigh impregnable.</p>
<p>Setting himself earnestly to the task, Kaupeepee soon transformed
the promontory of Haupu into one of the strongest fortresses in all the
group. He surrounded the plateau with massive stone walls overlooking
the declivities, and across the narrow neck leading to the mountains
raised a rocky barrier ten feet in thickness and twenty feet in height,
around which aggression from without was rendered impracticable by the
excavation of precipices leading to, and in vertical line with, the
ends of the wall. Instead of a gate, a subterranean passage-way led
under the wall, the inside entrance being covered in times of danger
with a huge flat stone resting on rollers.</p>
<p>Although the passage was rough and in unfavorable weather attended
with danger, canoes could enter the mouths of both gulches and be
hauled up beyond the reach of the waves, and beyond <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>the
reach of enemies as well; for above the entrances, and completely
commanding them, frowned the broad battlements of Haupu, from which
might be hurled hundreds of tons of rocks and other destructive
missiles. With ingenuity and great labor narrow foot-paths were cut
leading from the middle terrace to both gulches, some distance above
their openings, and affording a means of entering and leaving the
fortress by water. These paths connected with the terrace through
narrow passage-ways under the walls, and a single arm could defend them
against a host.</p>
<p>Within the walls buildings were erected capable of accommodating in
an emergency two or three thousand warriors, and on the lower terrace,
occupied by Kaupeepee and his household, including his confidential
friends and captains, a small <i>heiau</i> overlooked the sea, with a
priest and two or three assistants in charge. Mountain-paths led from
the fortress to Kalaupapa and other productive parts of the island; and
as fish could be taken in abundance, and Kaupeepee and many of his
followers controlled <i>taro</i> and other lands in the valleys beyond,
it was seldom that the stronghold was short of food, even when foraging
expeditions to the neighboring islands failed.</p>
<p>The services of the courageous alone were accepted by Kaupeepee, and
it was a wild and daring warfare that the little band waged for years
against the alien chiefs and their subjects. They could put afloat a
hundred war-canoes, and their operations, although usually confined to
Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii, sometimes in a spirit of bravado extended to
Kauai. Leaving their retreat, they hovered near the coast selected for
pillage until after dark, and then landed and mercilessly used the
torch and spear. This part of their work was quickly done, when they
filled their canoes with the choicest plunder they could find or of
which they were most in need, and before daylight made sail for Haupu.
Women were sometimes the booty coveted by the buccaneers, and during
their raids many a screaming beauty was seized and borne to their
stronghold on Molokai, where in most instances she was so kindly
treated that she soon lost all desire to be liberated. Occasionally
they were followed, if the winds were unfavorable to their retreat, by
hastily-equipped fleets of canoes. If they allowed themselves to be
overtaken it was for the amusement of driving back their pursuers; but
as a rule they escaped without <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75"
href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>pursuit or punishment, leaving
their victims in ignorance alike of the source and motive of the
assault.</p>
<p>A prominent chief of Oahu, whose territory had been ravaged by
Kaupeepee, traced the retiring fleet of the plunderers to the coast of
Molokai, when it suddenly disappeared. He landed and paid his respects
to the venerable Kamauaua, then at Kalaupapa, and craved his assistance
in discovering and punishing the spoilers, who must have found shelter
somewhere on the island. The old chief smiled grimly as he replied:
&ldquo;It is not necessary to search for your enemies. You will find
them at Haupu, near the ocean. They are probably waiting for you. They
do not disturb me or my people. If they have wronged you, land and
punish them. You have my permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Oahu chief offered his thanks and departed. He made a partial
reconnoissance of Haupu, ascertained that it was defended by but a few
hundred warriors, and shortly after returned with a large fleet of
canoes to capture and retain possession of the place. Arriving off the
entrance to the gulches, and discovering a number of war-canoes drawn
up on their steep banks, he opened the campaign by ordering their
seizure. Sixty canoes filled with warriors rode the surf into the
gulches, where they were met by avalanches of rocks from the walls of
the fortress, which dashed the most of them in pieces. The chief was
startled and horrified, and, believing the gods were raining rocks down
upon his fleet, he rescued such of his warriors as were able to reach
him from the wrecked canoes, and hastily departed for Oahu, not again
to return.</p>
<p>It is said that Kamauaua watched this assault upon Haupu from the
hills back of the fortress, and, in token of his pleasure at the
result, sent to Kaupeepee a feather cloak, and gave him the privilege
of taking fish for his warriors from one of the largest of the royal
ponds on the island. He also quietly presented him with a barge, than
which there were few larger in the group. It would accommodate more
than a hundred warriors and their equipments, and was intended for long
and rough voyages.</p>
<p>These barges were constructed of planks strongly corded together
over a frame, and calked and pitched. They were sometimes ten or more
feet in width, and were partially or wholly decked over, with a depth
of hold of six or eight feet. It was in vessels of this class, and in
large double canoes of equal or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76"
href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>greater burden, that distant
voyages were made to and from the Hawaiian Islands during the migratory
periods of the past, while the single and double canoes of smaller
dimensions, hollowed from the trunks of single trees, were used in
warfare, fishing, and in general inter-island communication. After the
final suspension of intercourse, in the twelfth century, between the
Hawaiian and Society Islands&mdash;the possible result of the
disappearance of a guiding line of small islands and atolls dotting the
ocean at intervals between the two groups&mdash;the barges referred to
gradually went out of use with the abandonment of voyages to distant
lands, and were almost unknown to the Hawaiians as early as one or two
centuries ago. Their spread of sail was very considerable, but oars
were also used, and the mariner shaped his course by the sun and stars,
and was guided to land by the flights of birds, drifting wood, and
currents of which he knew the direction.</p>
<p>Some of the double canoes with which the barges were supplanted were
scarcely less capacious and seaworthy than the barges themselves. They
were hollowed from the trunks of gigantic pines that had drifted to the
islands from the northern coast of America, and when one was found
years sometimes elapsed before wind and current provided a proper mate.
One of the single-trunk double canoes of Kamehameha I. was one hundred
and eight feet in length, and both single and double canoes of from
fifty to eighty feet in length were quite common during his reign, when
the native forests abounded in growths much larger than can now be
found. But the native trees never furnished bodies for the larger sizes
of canoes. They were the gifts of the waves, and were not unfrequently
credited to the favor of the gods.</p>
<p>Kaupeepee was delighted with the present of the barge. It gave him
one of the largest vessels in all the eight Hawaiian seas, and rendered
him especially formidable in sea-encounters. He painted the sails red
and the hull to the water-line, and from the masthead flung a saucy
pennon to the breeze, surmounted by a <i>kahili</i>, which might have
been mistaken for Von Tromp&rsquo;s broom had it been seen a few
centuries later in northern seas. He provided a large crew of oarsmen,
and made a more secure landing for it in one of the openings near the
fortress.</p>
<p>With this substantial addition to his fleet Kaupeepee enlarged
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>the scope of his depredations, and his red sails
were known and feared on the neighboring coasts of Oahu and Maui. Haupu
was filled with the spoil of his expeditions, and the return of a
successful raiding party was usually celebrated with a season of
feasting, singing, dancing, and other boisterous merriment. Nor were
the gods forgotten. Frequent festivals were given to <i>Kane</i>,
<i>Ku</i>, and <i>Lono</i>; and <i>Moaalii</i>, the shark-god of
Molokai&mdash;the god of the fisherman and mariner&mdash;was always the
earliest to be remembered. A huge image of this deity overlooked the
ocean from the north wall of the <i>heiau</i> of Haupu, and <i>leis</i>
of fresh flowers adorned its shoulders whenever a dangerous expedition
departed or returned. On one occasion this god had guided Kaupeepee to
Haupu during a dark and rainy night, and on another had capsized a
number of Oahuan war-canoes that had adroitly separated him from his
fleet in Pailolo channel.</p>
<p>At that period the islands were generally ruled by virtually
independent district chiefs. They recognized a supreme head, or
<i>alii-nui</i>, but were absolute lords of their several territories,
and wars between them were frequent; but they were wars of plunder
rather than of conquest, and sometimes continued in a desultory way
until both parties were impoverished, when their chiefs and priests met
and arranged terms of peace. But Kaupeepee was inspired by a motive
higher than that of mere plunder. He hated the southern chiefs and
their successors, and his assaults were confined exclusively to the
territories over which they ruled. His sole aim was to inflict injury
upon them, and the spoils of his expeditions were distributed among his
followers. Brave, generous and sagacious, he was almost worshipped by
his people, and treason, with them, was a thing unthought of.</p>
<p>It was indeed a wild and reckless life that Kaupeepee and his daring
associates led; but it lacked neither excitement abroad nor amusement
at home. On the upper terrace a <i>kahua</i> channel had been cut,
along which they rolled the <i>maika</i> and threw the blunted dart.
They played <i>konane</i>, <i>puhenehene</i>, and <i>punipeki</i>, and
at surf-riding possessed experts of both sexes who might have travelled
far without finding their equals. The people of the island were
friendly with the dashing buccaneers, and the fairest damsels became
their wives, some of them living with their husbands at Haupu, and
others with their relatives in the valleys. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We will now return to Hina&mdash;or Hooho, as she was
sometimes called&mdash;the beautiful wife of Hakalanileo, nephew of
Paumakua, of Hawaii. Hakalanileo had acquired his possessions in Hilo
partly through the influence of his own family, and partly through his
marriage with the sister of a consequential district chief. Later in
life he had seen and become enamored of Hina, the daughter of Uli, and
prevailed upon her to become his wife<span class="corr" id="xd26e2927"
title="Not in source">.</span> The marriage was not acceptable to Uli.
The position and family connections of Hakalanileo were sufficiently
inviting, but Uli, who dealt in sorcery and magic, saw disaster in the
proposed union and advised her daughter against it. After much
persuasion, however, her consent was obtained; but she gave it with
this injunction:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you will have it so, take her, Hakalanileo; but guard
her well, for I can see that some day the winds will snatch her from
you, and you will behold her not again for many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it even as you say,&rdquo; replied Hakalanileo, &ldquo;I
will take the hazard. We do not well to reject a treasure because,
perchance, it may be stolen. Hina shall be my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus it was that Hina became the wife of the nephew of
Paumakua&mdash;Hina, the most beautiful maiden in all Hawaii; Hina,
whose eyes were like stars, and whose hair fell in waves below the
fringes of her <i>pau</i>; Hina, whose name has come down to us through
the centuries garlanded with song. And for years she lived happily with
Hakalanileo, who loved her above all others&mdash;lived with him until
she became the mother of two sons, Kana and Niheu; and then the winds
snatched her away from her husband, just as Uli had predicted six years
before. But the winds that bore her hence filled the sails of the great
barge of Kaupeepee.</p>
<p>The chief of Haupu had heard of her great beauty, and resolved to
see with his own eyes what the bards had exalted in song. Travelling
overland from Puna in disguise, he reached her home in Hilo, and saw
that the poets had done her no more than justice. She was beautiful
indeed, and the wife of one to whose blood he had vowed undying enmity.
Returning to Puna, where his barge lay in waiting for him, he hovered
around the coast of Hilo for some days, watching for an opportunity to
seize the woman whose charms had enraptured him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>At last it came. After sunset, when the moon was shining, Hina
repaired to the beach with her women to bathe. A signal was
given&mdash;it is thought by the first wife of Hakalanileo&mdash;and
not long after a light but heavily-manned canoe dashed through the surf
and shot in among the bathers. The women screamed and started for the
shore. Suddenly a man leaped from the canoe into the water. There was a
brief struggle, a stifled scream, a sharp word of command, and a moment
later Kaupeepee was again in the canoe with the nude and frantic Hina
in his arms.</p>
<p>The boatmen knew their business&mdash;knew the necessity of quick
work&mdash;and without a word the canoe was turned and driven through
the surf like an arrow. The barge, with a man at every oar and the
sails ready to hoist, was lying a short distance out at sea. A speck of
light guided the boatmen, and the barge was soon reached. All were
hastily transferred to it. The sails were spread, the men bent to their
oars, the canoe was taken in tow; and, while the alarm-drum was
sounding and fires were appearing on shore, Hina, wrapped in folds of
soft <i>kapa</i>, sat sobbing in one of the apartments of the barge,
and was being swiftly borne by wind and oar toward the fortress of
Haupu.</p>
<p>The return to Haupu occupied a little more than two days. During
that time Hina had mourned continually and partaken of no food.
Kaupeepee had treated her with respect and kindness; but she was
bewildered with the shock of her abduction, and begged to be either
killed or returned to her children.</p>
<p>The party landed a little before daylight. The sea was rough, but
the moon shone brightly, and the passage into the mouth of one of the
gulches was made without accident. In the arms of Kaupeepee Hina was
borne up the rock-hewn path to the fortress, and placed in apartments
on the lower terrace provided with every comfort and luxury known to
the nobility of the islands at that period. They had been especially
prepared for her reception, and women were in attendance to wait upon
her and see that she wanted for nothing, except her liberty. The large
private room of the three communicating apartments&mdash;the one
designed for her personal occupation&mdash;was a model of barbaric
taste and comfort, and to its adornment many of the exposed districts
of Oahu and Maui had unwillingly contributed. Its walls were tapestried
with finely-woven and brilliantly-colored <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>mattings, dropping from
festoons of shells and underlapping a carpet of hardier material
covering the level ground-floor. The beams of the ceiling were also
studded with shells and gaudily stained. On one side of the room was a
slightly-raised platform, thickly strewn with dry sea-grass and covered
with many folds of <i>kapa</i>. This was the <i>kapa-moe</i>, or
sleeping-couch. Opposite was a <i>kapa</i>-covered lounge extending
along the entire side of the room. In the middle of the apartment were
spread several thicknesses of mats, which served alike for eating and
lounging purposes. Light was admitted through two small openings
immediately under the eaves, and from the door when its heavy curtains
were looped aside. On a row of shelves in a corner of the room were
carved calabashes and other curious drinking-vessels, as well as
numerous ornaments of shells, ivory and feathers; and in huge
calabashes under them were stores of female attire of every description
then in use. In fact, nothing seemed to be wanting, and, in spite of
her grief, Hina could scarcely repress a feeling of delight as she was
shown into the apartment and the <i>kukui</i> torches displayed its
luxurious appointments.</p>
<p>Declining food, Hina dismissed her attendants, and, throwing herself
on the <i>kapa-moe</i>, was soon folded in the soft mantle of sleep and
carried back in dreams to the home from which she had been ravished.
The room was dark, and she slept for many hours. Awaking, she could not
for a moment recollect where she was; but gradually the events of the
preceding three days came to her, and she appreciated that she was a
prisoner in the hands of Kaupeepee, of whose name and exploits she was
not ignorant, and that repining would secure her neither liberation nor
kind treatment. Therefore, with a sagacity to be expected of the
daughter of Uli, and not without a certain feeling of pride as she
reflected that her beauty had inspired Kaupeepee to abduct her, she
admitted her attendants, attired herself becomingly, partook heartily
of a breakfast of fish, <i>poi</i>, potatoes and fruits, and then sent
word to Kaupeepee that she would be pleased to see him.</p>
<p>Kaupeepee expected a storm of tears and reproaches as he entered the
room, but was agreeably disappointed. Hina rose, bowed, and waited for
him to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; inquired Kaupeepee in a kindly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>tone, while a just perceptible smile of triumph
swept across his handsome face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liberate me,&rdquo; replied Hina promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are free to go anywhere within the walls of Haupu,&rdquo;
returned Kaupeepee, moving his arms around as if they embraced the
whole world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Return me to my children,&rdquo; said Hina; and at thought of
them her eyes flashed with earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; was the firm reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then kill me!&rdquo; exclaimed Hina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see me before I had the pleasure of embracing
you in the water on the coast of Hilo?&rdquo; inquired the chief,
evasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Hina, curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I saw you before that time,&rdquo; continued
Kaupeepee&mdash;&ldquo;saw you in your house; saw you among the palms;
saw you by the waters. I made a journey overland from Puna to see
you&mdash;to see the wife of my enemy, the most beautiful woman in
Hawaii.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hina was but a woman, and of a race and time when the promptings of
the heart were not fettered by rigid rules of propriety. Kaupeepee was
the handsome and distinguished son of a king, and his words of praise
were not unpleasant to her. She therefore bent her eyes to the floor
and remained silent while he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hina would think little of the man who would risk his life to
possess himself of such a woman, and then kill or cast her off as not
worth the keeping. You are like no other woman; I am like no other man.
Such companionship has the approval of the gods, and you will leave
Haupu only when its walls shall have been battered down and Kaupeepee
lies dead among the ruins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this terrible declaration Hina could offer no reply. The
fierceness of this prince of the old line of Nanaula, this enemy of her
people, this scourge of the southern chiefs, alike charmed and
frightened her, and with her hands to her face she sank upon the lounge
of <i>kapa</i> beside which she had been standing.</p>
<p>The chief regarded her for a moment, perhaps with a feeling of pity;
then, placing his hand upon her shoulder, he softly said: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not be unhappy in Haupu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will the bird sing that is covered with a calabash?&rdquo;
replied Hina, raising her eyes. &ldquo;I am your prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more my prisoner than I am yours,&rdquo; rejoined the
chief, gallantly. &ldquo;Therefore, as fellow-prisoners, let us make
the best of walls that shut out no sunshine, and of gates that are a
bar only against intrusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How brave, and yet how gentle!&rdquo; mused Hina, as
Kaupeepee, feeling that he had said enough, turned and left the room.
&ldquo;How strangely pleasant are his words and voice! No one ever
spoke so to me before. I could have listened longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that Hina harkened for the footsteps of Kaupeepee, and lived
to forget that she was a prisoner in the fortress of Haupu. His love
gently wooed her thoughts from the past and made sweet the bondage
which he shared with her.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The sudden disappearance of Hina created a profound
excitement among the people of that part of the coast of Hilo from
which she had been abducted. The women who had been permitted to escape
ran screaming to the house of Hakalanileo with their tale of woe, and
soon for miles around the country was in arms. When questioned, all
they could tell was that a canoe filled with armed men suddenly dashed
through the surf, and their mistress was seized and borne out to sea.
This was all they knew.</p>
<p>Canoes were suddenly equipped and sent in pursuit, but they returned
before morning with the report that nothing had been seen of the
abductors. Messengers were despatched to the coast settlements of
Hamakua, Hilo and Puna, but they brought no intelligence of the missing
woman. Uli was consulted, but her divinations failed, for the reason,
as she informed the unhappy husband, that the powers that had warned
her against the marriage of her daughter and foreshadowed the result
could not be prevailed upon to impart any information that would
interfere with the fulfilment of the prophecy. Uli, therefore, sat down
in gloom to await the developments of time, and Hakalanileo started on
a systematic search through the group for his lost wife. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span></p>
<p>After visiting every district and almost every village on Hawaii, he
proceeded with a small party of attendants to Maui, and thence to
Molokai, Oahu, Kauai and Niihau, and back to Lanai and Kahoolawe; but
no trace of Hina could be discovered. He was well received by the
various chiefs, and assistance was freely offered and sometimes
accepted; but all search was in vain, and he returned disheartened to
Hawaii after an absence of more than two years.</p>
<p>But his first search was not his last. During the fifteen years that
followed he made frequent voyages to the different islands on the same
errand, and always with the same result. He offered sacrifices in the
temples, made pledges to the gods, and consulted every <i>kaula</i> of
note of whom he had knowledge; but his offerings and promises failed to
secure the assistance of the unseen powers, and the <i>kilos</i> and
astrologers could gather nothing of importance to him from their
observations.</p>
<p>Meantime Kana and Niheu, the sons of Hina, grew to manhood and
prepared to continue the search for their mother, which Hakalanileo had
at last abandoned as hopeless. Again and again had their grandmother
told them the story of the abduction of Hina, and as often had they
vowed to devote their lives to a solution of the mystery of her fate.
It was vouchsafed to Uli to see that her daughter lived, but beyond
that her charms and incantations were fruitless. But when the beards of
her grandsons began to grow she felt that the time was approaching when
Hina&rsquo;s hiding-place would be discovered, and she inspired them to
become proficient in the use of arms and the arts of war. And to their
assistance she brought the instruction of supernatural powers.</p>
<p>Niheu became endowed not only with great personal strength and
courage, but with unerring instincts of strategy and all the
accomplishments of a successful military leader. To Kana were given
powers of a different nature. He could contract his body to the compass
of an insect, and expand or extend it almost indefinitely; but he was
permitted to do neither except in cases of imminent personal peril, as
the faculty was rarely imparted to mortals, and in this instance was
accorded by <i>Kanaloa</i> without the knowledge of the powers to which
that deity was subject.</p>
<p>Finally, after a season of long and patient inquiry, it was
developed to Uli that her daughter was secreted in the fortress of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>Haupu and could be recovered only by force, as she
had long been the wife of Kaupeepee and would not be surrendered
peacefully. Hakalanileo regarded the development with distrust; for
while at Kalaupapa, on the island of Molokai, less than three years
before, word was brought to him from Kaupeepee, offering to open the
fortress of Haupu to his inspection. Hence, when his sons set about
raising a large force to attack that stronghold, he gave them every
assistance in his power, but declined to accompany the expedition.</p>
<p>Before noting with greater detail the warlike preparations of
Hina&rsquo;s sons, let us refer briefly to the changes which the years
leading them to manhood had brought to others connected with the events
of this legend. Hina had been a not unhappy captive at Haupu for nearly
seventeen years, during which Kaupeepee had continued his desultory
assaults upon the usurping chiefs of the neighboring islands. His name
had become known throughout the entire group, and several combined
attacks upon Haupu had been repulsed&mdash;the last by land, led by a
distinguished Maui chief, with a slaughter so great that the adjoining
gulches were choked with the slain. The venerable Kamauaua had passed
away, leaving the government of Molokai to his son, Keoloewa, who had
married Nuakea, daughter of the powerful chief, Keaunui, of Oahu, and
sister of Lakona, of the strain of Maweke. Moi, another of
Nuakea&rsquo;s brothers, had joined Kaupeepee at Haupu, and became not
only his steadfast friend and adviser, but his <i>kaula</i>, or
prophet, as well.</p>
<p>Paumakua had died at a very old age, and was buried at Iao, leaving
his titles, <i>meles</i> and possessions to his son, Haho; but the
change did not seem to affect the holdings of Hakalanileo in Hilo,
although it brought to his sons some support in their subsequent war
with Kaupeepee. Haho was a haughty but warlike chief, and refused to
recognize the titles of many of the native nobles; and, to permanently
degrade them, he founded the <i>Aha-alii</i>, or college of chiefs,
which embraced the blue-blooded of the entire group, and remained in
vogue as late as the beginning of the present century. To be recognized
by this college of heraldry, it was necessary for every chief to name
his descent from an ancestor of unquestioned nobility; and when his
rank was thus formally established, no circumstance of war or peace
could deprive him of it. There were gradations of rank and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span><i>tabu</i> within the <i>Aha-alii</i>, and all
received the respect to which their rank entitled them, without regard
to their worldly condition. No chief could claim a higher grade than
the source from which he sprang; nor could he achieve it, although
through marriage with a chiefess of higher rank he might advance his
children to the grade of the mother. The <i>Aha-alii</i> had a language
which was not understood by the common people, and which was changed
whenever it became known to the <i>makaainana</i>, and it was their
right on all occasions to wear the insignia of their rank, the feather
wreath (<i>lei-hulu</i>), the feather cape (<i>aha-ula</i>), and the
ivory clasp (<i>palaoa</i>); and their canoes might be painted red and
bear a pennon. The royal color was yellow.</p>
<p>Although Kaupeepee was of the undoubted blood of Nanaula, and would
not have been denied admission to the <i>Aha-alii</i>, he treated with
contempt the institution of nobility founded by Haho, declaring that
the blood of the founder himself was ennobled only through the thefts
of his low-born grandfather. This was doubtless correct; but
Kaupeepee&rsquo;s hatred of the southern invaders would not allow him
to be just, even to their ancestors.</p>
<p>Such was the condition of affairs when the sons of Hina began to
prepare for their expedition against Haupu. They sent emissaries to
Oahu and Maui, and were promised substantial co-operation by the
leading chiefs of those islands, the most of whom had suffered from the
raids of the scourge of Molokai. They collected a mighty fleet of
canoes and a force of six thousand warriors. As many more were promised
from Oahu and Maui, which, were Keoloewa&rsquo;s permission obtained,
would be landed at Molokai to operate in conjunction with the army from
Hawaii.</p>
<p>As an attack on Haupu from the sea side was not considered
practicable, even with the overwhelming force that was being organized
against it, messengers were despatched to Molokai to prevail upon
Keoloewa to permit a portion of the united armies to land on the south
side of the island and assault the fortress from the mountain. His
sympathies were with his brother, and he hesitated; but when he learned
of the formidable force organizing for the reduction of Haupu, he
appreciated that he was unable to successfully oppose the movement,
and, with the assurance that his subjects would be neither disturbed
nor despoiled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>of their property during the conflict, and that
the invading armies would be withdrawn from the island at the end of
the campaign against Haupu, he consented to the landing. Had he known
the real motive of the assault he would have advised his brother to
surrender his fair prisoner and save both from possible ruin; but,
conceiving that Kaupeepee&rsquo;s depredations had become unendurable,
and that the chiefs of the great islands had at length united to crush
him, for his own safety he felt compelled to leave him to his fate.</p>
<p>This resolution accorded with the advice of Kaupeepee. Many days
before his faithful <i>kaula</i> had told him of the approaching
invasion, of the combination of chiefs against him, and the doubtful
result of the struggle; and before the messengers reached his brother
he had gone to and advised him to offer no opposition to the landing of
his enemies on the island. &ldquo;Opposition would be useless,&rdquo;
argued Kaupeepee, &ldquo;for my enemies are coming in great force. I
have slain them and blasted their lands, and single-handed will meet
the consequences. Do not embroil yourself with me, but save to our
blood the possessions of our fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; said Keoloewa; &ldquo;but why
not abandon Haupu and save yourself, if you are not able to hold
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; exclaimed Kaupeepee. &ldquo;For more than
twenty years its walls have stood between me and my enemies, and I will
not desert them now. I have a thousand brave men who will triumph or
die with me. Should Haupu be taken, go and count the corpses around its
walls, and you will not blush to see how a son of Kamauaua
died!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So let the will of the gods be done!&rdquo; replied the
brother. &ldquo;But we may not meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; returned Kaupeepee, with a strange
smile&mdash;&ldquo;true, my good brother, for my sepulchre at Haupu
needs ornamenting before the mourners come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my name take anything required for your defence,&rdquo;
said Keoloewa, still holding the hand of his brother, as if reluctant
to part with him; &ldquo;my heart, if not my arm, will be with
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be well prepared,&rdquo; were the words of Kaupeepee
at parting; and before he reached the top of the <i>pali</i> on his
return to Haupu, the messengers from Hawaii landed at Kalaupapa.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span></p>
<p>With this concession from Keoloewa the arrangements for the campaign
were speedily made. The main body of the united forces was to
concentrate at Kaunakakai, on the north side of the island, and move
under the supreme leadership of Niheu, while a large detachment,
embracing the best seamen of the several quotas, was to blockade the
sea-entrances to Haupu, destroy the canoes of the fortress to prevent
escape or succor, and co-operate generally with the land forces. This
dangerous service was entrusted to the command of Kana.</p>
<p>At the appointed time the Hawaiian army set sail for Molokai in a
fleet of over twelve hundred canoes, many of them double, and carrying
a large supply of provisions. The assistance of the gods had been
invoked with many sacrifices, and the omens had been favorable. In one
of the large double canoes was Uli. Her form was bent with age, and her
hair, white as foam, covered her shoulders like a mantle. In youth she
was noted for her stateliness and beauty; but age and care had
destroyed all traces of her early comeliness, and her wrinkled face,
and black eyes glistening through the rifts of her long, white hair,
gave her the appearance of one who dealt with things to be feared. She
was surrounded with charms and images, and before her, on a
stone-bordered hearth of earth, burned a continual fire, into which she
at intervals threw gums and oily mixtures, emitting clouds of incense.
Her canoe followed that of the sons of Hina, with their priest and
war-god, and red pennon at the masthead; and as the fleet swept out
into the ocean, with thousands of oars in the waves and thousands of
spears in the air, Uli rose to her feet and began a wild war-chant,
which was taken up by the following hosts and borne far over the
waters.</p>
<p>The day following a number of expeditions left various openings on
the coasts of Oahu and Maui&mdash;none of them approaching the Hawaiian
army in strength, but together adding an aggregate of nine hundred
canoes of all sizes and about four thousand warriors to the invading
force. All of them reached the landing at Kaunakakai on the day
appointed for their arrival, and Niheu found himself in command of ten
thousand warriors and over two thousand canoes. No such number of
spears was ever before seen massed on Molokai; but the people had been
assured that they would not be injured either in person or property so
long as they remained peaceful, and the terms of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>agreement with Keoloewa were faithfully observed.
Among the invaders the people found many friends and relatives, for
intercourse between the islands at that time was free and frequent; and
although their sympathies were with Kaupeepee, they soon came to regard
the projected capture of Haupu as a great game of <i>konane</i>, played
by agreement between two champions, during which the spectators were to
remain silent and make no suggestions.</p>
<p>The tents of the chiefs, around which were encamped their respective
followers, extended along the shore for more than two miles, while the
beach for a greater distance was fringed with canoes, many of the
larger painted red and bearing gaudy pennons of stout <i>kapa</i>. As
plundering had been forbidden, provisions of dried fish, potatoes,
cocoanuts, <i>taro</i>, and live pigs and fowls had been brought in
considerable quantities in extra canoes; but as the duration of the
campaign could only be surmised, rolls of <i>kapa</i> and matting,
shell wreaths, ivory, feather capes, calabashes, mechanical tools,
ornaments, and extra arms were also brought, to be fairly exchanged
from time to time for such supplies as might be wanted.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Everything being in readiness for an advance upon the
stronghold of Kaupeepee, a war-council of the assembled chiefs was
called. Among them were several who were well informed concerning the
approaches to Haupu, and the main features of the campaign were
arranged without discussion. Signals and other means of communication
between the two divisions having been agreed upon, the next morning a
detachment of two thousand men, occupying five hundred canoes, under
the command of Kana, moved around the island to blockade the entrances
to Haupu, and immediately after the main army, leaving a strong reserve
to guard the canoes and look after supplies, broke camp and took up its
line of march across the island to the mountains back of the fortress.
The trails were rough, but at sunrise the next morning the land
division, stretched along the summit of the hills two miles back of
Haupu, looked down and saw the fleet of Kana drawn like a broad, black
line around the ocean entrances to the doomed stronghold. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>Meantime Kaupeepee had not been idle. Every movement of the enemy
had been watched; and when word came to him that the shores of
Kaunakakai were so crowded with warriors that the number could not be
told, he grimly answered: &ldquo;Then will our spears be less likely to
miss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The walls of the fortress had been strengthened and replenished with
missiles; large quantities of provisions had been secured, and sheds of
ample space were finally erected for the collection of rain-water,
should communication be interrupted with the streams in the gulches
below. Before the enemy had reached positions completely cutting off
retreat from the fortress, Kaupeepee had called his warriors together
and thus addressed them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warriors and friends!&mdash;for all, indeed, are warriors and
friends in Haupu!&mdash;for years you have shared in the dangers of
Kaupeepee and have never disobeyed him. Listen now to his words, and
heed them well. A mighty army is about to surround Haupu by land and
sea. It already blackens the shores of Kaunakakai, and will soon be
thundering at our gates. The fight will be long and desperate, and may
end in defeat and death to the most or all of us. I cannot order,
cannot even ask you to face such peril for my sake. The gates are open.
Let all leave with my good-will whose lives are precious to them. Let
your acts answer at once, for the enemy is approaching and no time can
be lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment not a warrior of the thousand present moved. All stood
staring at their chief and wondering that he should doubt. Then a
confused hum of voices, rising louder and louder, swelled into a united
shout of &ldquo;Close the gates!&rdquo; and Kaupeepee was answered. And
a braver answer was never given than that which came from the stout
hearts and unblanched lips of the thousand fearless defenders of Haupu.
The gates were closed, with not a single warrior missing, and the
fortress was soon environed with its enemies.</p>
<p>Halting his army on the summit of the mountains overlooking Haupu,
Niheu despatched a messenger to the fortress with a signal of peace, to
ascertain with certainty whether Hina was a prisoner there, and, if so,
to demand the surrender of the captive. The messenger returned in
safety, bearing this message from Kaupeepee: &ldquo;Hina is within the
walls of Haupu. Come with arms in your hands and take her!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span></p>
<p>Communication was established with the fleet in front of Haupu, and
Kana was advised to enter the gulches in force the next morning,
destroy the canoes of the fortress, and maintain a footing there, if
possible, while a strong division of the land forces would move down
and draw attention to the rear defences by taking a position within
attacking distance.</p>
<p>In pursuance of this plan, early next morning Niheu despatched a
formidable force down the mountain in the rear of Haupu, with orders to
menace but not to assault the defences. Arriving near the walls, a
little skirmishing ensued, when the detachment took a position beyond
the reach of the slingers, and began the construction of a stone wall
across the ridge.</p>
<p>Meantime Kana&rsquo;s fleet of canoes, which had been hovering
nearer and nearer the walls of Haupu since daylight, with a wild
battle-cry from the warriors crowding them suddenly dashed through the
surf, and partially succeeded in effecting a landing in one of the
gulches flanking the fortress. So rapid had been the movement, and so
thoroughly had the attention of the besieged been engrossed with the
diversion from the mountains, that a division of the assaulting party
managed to reach the canoes of the fortress, and another to secure a
lodgment among the rocks on the opposite side of the gulch, before
meeting with serious opposition. The score or two of warriors left to
guard the canoes of the fortress were quickly overpowered and
slaughtered, and then the work of destruction began. With loose rocks
and heavy stone hammers the canoes were being hastily broken in pieces,
including the great war-barge of Kaupeepee, when from the walls above
the destroyers was precipitated a bewildering and murderous avalanche
of rocks of all sizes and heavy sections of tree-trunks. As the
missiles rolled and bounded down the steep declivity, sweeping it at
almost the same moment for two hundred yards or more in length, the
ground trembled as with an earthquake, and the gorge was filled with a
dense cloud of dust.</p>
<p>The thunder of the avalanche ceased, and in the awful silence that
succeeded Kaupeepee, at the head of two hundred warriors, dashed down
the narrow path leading from the middle terrace to finish the dreadful
work with spear, knife and battle-axe. The sight was appalling, even to
the chief of Haupu. The gulch was choked with the bodies of the dying
and the dead. Panic-stricken, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href=
"#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>those posted on the opposite hillside
had abandoned their only place of safety, and perished in large numbers
in attempting to reach their canoes. The few left alive and able to
retreat were wildly struggling to escape seaward from the gulch in such
canoes of their wrecked fleet as would still float, or by plunging
desperately into the surf.</p>
<p>With exultant shouts Kaupeepee and his warriors sprang over their
dead and dying enemies and swept down upon the unarmed and escaping
remnant of the invaders. Although a considerable reserve of canoes came
to their rescue from without, protected from assault from above by the
presence of Kaupeepee and his party, the most of the fugitives would
have been cut off but for the extraordinary efforts of Kana, who led
the attacking party, but miraculously escaped unhurt. In the surf, in
the deep entrance to the gulch, everywhere he moved around with his
head and shoulders above the water. He assisted the canoes through the
breakers, rescued exhausted and drowning swimmers, and from the bottom
of the ocean reached down and gathered huge rocks, which he hurled at
intervals at Kaupeepee&rsquo;s warriors to keep them in check. These
wonderful exploits awed the attacking party, and greater still was
their astonishment when they saw the strange being finally walk through
the deep waters, erect and with his head and breast exposed, and step
into a canoe quite half a mile from the shore. Turning to his warriors,
with these words Kaupeepee answered their looks of inquiry: &ldquo;He
is Kana. I have heard of him. I am glad he escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kana returned with his shattered fleet and still worsely shattered
army to Kaunakakai. As the most of his canoes had been destroyed,
Kaupeepee was unable to follow the retreating enemy to sea, but,
hearing the shouts of conflict above, at once mounted with his warriors
to the fortress, to assist in repelling an attack on the rear wall
which had been hastily begun to save, if possible, the sea party from
destruction. With Kaupeepee at the front the assault was quickly
repulsed, the enemy retiring in confusion behind the lines of defence
from which the advance had been made.</p>
<p>The wounded in the gulch were despatched, six of the least injured
being reserved for sacrifice, and the night following the fortress of
Haupu was ablaze with savage joy. As the first-fruits of the victories
of the day, the six wounded prisoners were slain <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>with
clubs and laid upon the altar of the <i>heiau</i> as offerings to the
gods, and chants of defiance were sent through the night air to the
discomfited enemy beyond the walls.</p>
<p>These disasters did not dishearten Niheu. The canoes of the fortress
had been destroyed, and that was something of a compensation for the
loss of nearly two thousand of his best warriors and a considerable
part of his fleet. Plans for further assaults from the sea were
abandoned, and a regular siege, with a final entrance by the rear wall,
was suggested and in the end agreed to by the chiefs in council.</p>
<p>Lines of pickets were accordingly stationed along the summits of the
mountains flanking the fortress, in order to prevent the entrance into
it of reinforcements or supplies, and the main body of the attacking
force was moved down and placed in positions within slinging distance
of the rear wall. This was not done without loss, for the wall was
manned with expert slingers; but in less than a week the besiegers had
advanced their main line of wooden defences within a hundred paces of
the rear bulwark of the fortress and were daily gaining ground.</p>
<p>This movable line of assault and defence was a device as ingenious
as it was effective. Timbers twenty feet in length, or corresponding
with the height of the wall, were firmly corded together side by side
until they stretched across the narrow summit leading to the fortress.
To the top of each fourth or fifth timber was lashed a movable brace
thirty feet in length, and then the wooden wall was raised into the air
nearly erect, and securely held in that position by its line of
supporting braces. It was a formidable-looking structure. Against it
the missiles of the besieged fell harmless, and behind it the besiegers
worked in safety.</p>
<p>Section by section and foot by foot this moving line of timber was
advanced, until the warriors on the wall could almost touch it with
their spears. Several desperate sorties, to destroy or prostrate it,
had been made, but nothing beyond the cutting of a few of the lower
fastenings had been achieved; and the defenders of Haupu, with
tightened grasp of their weapons, grimly awaited the final assault,
which they felt would not long be delayed. Day after day, night after
night, they watched; but the wooden wall did not move, and they could
only guess at what was going on behind it. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span></p>
<p>Finally a night of inky darkness came&mdash;a night &ldquo;as dark
as the farthest confines of <i>Po</i>&rdquo;&mdash;bringing with it a
storm of wind and rain. In the midst of the storm the wooden wall began
to move, but so noiselessly that the advance was not perceived by the
fortress sentinels. Midnight came and went; the storm continued, and
nearer and nearer to the wall of stone was crowded the wall of timber.
Just as coming day began to streak the east the bases of the two walls
came together, the backward inclination of both leaving them a few feet
apart at their tops. Hundreds of men then laid hold of the braces, and
in a moment the wooden wall was shoved over and stayed against the
other.</p>
<p>The alarm was given within, and warriors from all parts of the
enclosure sprang toward the menaced wall. But the movement of their
enemies was not less prompt. Up the braces they swarmed in such numbers
that the few who had succeeded in reaching the top of the wall from
within were hurled from it, and after them poured a cataract of spears
against which the opposing force was powerless. The huge stone was
rolled back, the gate was opened, and soon the upper terrace was
cleared and five thousand warriors, led by Niheu in person, were
sweeping down to complete their work of slaughter.</p>
<p>But their victory was not to be cheaply purchased. They had slain
two or three hundred on the wall and around the gate, but thrice as
many more, under the desperate leadership of Kaupeepee, were stretched
like a wall across the middle terrace, with a resolution to contest
every pace of the ground with their lives. They might have escaped,
perhaps, down the paths leading from that terrace to the gulches; but
they preferred to die, as they had for years lived, in defence of
Haupu.</p>
<p>Down the terrace swept the victorious horde in the gray dawn of the
morning. Niheu vainly tried to hold his warriors in check, for he knew
the main body of the fortress force was still before him, and would
have advanced with prudence; but the voices of the leaders were drowned
in the battle-shouts of the surging throng, which in a few minutes
struck Kaupeepee&rsquo;s wall of spears and battle-axes, and rolled
back like a storm-wave broken against the front of Haupu. But the check
was only momentary, for immediately behind the shattered column was a
forest of advancing spears, and with a wild tumult of shouts and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>clashing weapons the entire force was precipitated
upon Kaupeepee&rsquo;s thin but resolute lines of defence.</p>
<p>The slaughter was frightful; but the unequal conflict could have but
one result. Kaupeepee and the fifty or less of his followers left
standing were crowded, fighting step by step, into the lower terrace,
and thence to the <i>heiau</i>, and finally to the temple as a last
place of defence. There the struggle was brief. The roof of the temple
was fired, and as Kaupeepee and the last of his devoted band sprang
from the blazing building to die at the throats of their enemies they
were struck down with their javelins in the air. A spear penetrated the
breast of Kaupeepee. As a last act he poised his <i>ihe</i> to hurl at
a helmeted chief who had just struggled to the front. The chief was
Niheu. By his dress or face, which bore a resemblance to the features
of Hina, Kaupeepee must have recognized him. He looked, but his arm did
not move. &ldquo;Not for your sake, but for hers!&rdquo; exclaimed the
dying warrior, dropping his weapon to the earth and falling lifeless
beside it.</p>
<p>Not one of the defenders of Haupu escaped, but more than one-half of
Niheu&rsquo;s army perished in the various assaults upon the fortress.
Hina was found uninjured, and, while there was great joy to her in the
embrace of her sons and aged mother, she wept over the death of
Kaupeepee, who with his love had made light her long imprisonment.</p>
<p>The body of Kaupeepee was given to Keoloewa for interment, as were
also the remains of Moi, who was among the last to fall. The walls of
Haupu were levelled, never to be raised again, and Hina returned to her
husband in Hilo, after a separation of nearly eighteen years, thus
bringing to a close one of the most romantic legends of early Hawaiian
chivalry. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=

<p class="first">About the period of <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1160
Kanipahu was the nominal sovereign of the island of Hawaii. He was the
grandson of Pili, who near the close of the previous century came from
Samoa, at the solicitation of the high-priest Paao, to assume the
<i>moiship</i> left vacant by the death of Kapawa, whose grandfather
was probably the first of the southern chiefs who came to the Hawaiian
group during the important migratory movements of the eleventh and
twelfth centuries.</p>
<p>Although the sovereignty of the entire island was claimed by the
Pili family, disturbances were frequent in the time of Kanipahu, and a
few of the native chiefs of the old stock of Nanaula, which held sway
in the group for nearly six centuries, refused to yield allegiance to
the new dynasty. To strengthen his power and placate the native chiefs
and people, Kanipahu took to wife Hualani, the fifth in descent from
Maweke, of the Nanaula line, and subsequently Alaikaua, who was
probably of the same native strain.</p>
<p>The <i>makaainana</i>, or common people, however, seem to have been
better satisfied with their new rulers than were their former chiefs
who had been supplanted in authority, and it was therefore with
difficulty that they could be aroused to a resistance to political
conditions which imposed upon them no hardships which they had not
borne under their old rulers, and no responsibilities with which they
were not already familiar. And, besides, the new-comers from the south
had introduced new laws, new customs and new products of the soil, as
well as new gods and new forms of worship. They had brought with them
the <i>kaeke</i>, or sacred drum, and <i>puloulou</i>, or inviolable
<i>tabu</i> staff, crowned with balls of white or black <i>kapa</i>.
They had also instituted the title of <i>moi</i>, or supreme sovereign,
whereas the several islands before had been ruled by scores of
independent chiefs, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98"
name="pb98">98</a>]</span>each claiming and holding as large a district
as he was able to defend. They had established the <i>Aha-alii</i>, or
college of chiefs, through which the rank of every noble might find
recognition, and be perpetuated in his family. They had constructed
grander <i>heiaus</i>, or temples, and shut the populace from the
observance of many of their religious ceremonies. The <i>tabus</i> of
the chiefs and priests had been enlarged and rendered more strict, and
the priesthood had become more powerful and independent. The persons of
the <i>mois</i> and high chiefs had become more sacred, and they
exercised their functions with increased display and ostentation.</p>
<p>These additional exactions on the part of the new rulers, however,
were partially if not wholly compensated for to the laboring masses by
the protection brought to them through the political change against the
oppressions of their petty chiefs and land-owners; and it is therefore
probable that, on the whole, their social and industrial condition was
quite as tolerable under the new as under the old or native
<i>r&eacute;gime</i>.</p>
<p>Kanipahu resided principally in Kohala, where his grandfather had
taken up his abode, and constructed mansions consistent with his
sovereign state. And it was there that the high-priest Paao, who
brought Pili to the group, established himself and family, after first
landing in Puna and erecting to his god the temple of Wahaula, the
ruins of which are still seen near the village of Kahawalea. After the
arrival of Pili it is probable that Paao removed with him to the more
populous district of Kohala, and there remained as his high-priest and
adviser. At Puuepa he erected the large <i>heiau</i> of Mookini, the
stones for which were passed from hand-to-hand from Niulii, a distance
of nine miles&mdash;a circumstance indicating the presence of a large
population on Hawaii at that time. As it was one of the largest temples
in the group&mdash;its walls, enclosing an irregular parallelogram,
having an aggregate length of 817 feet, with a height of 20 feet, and a
breadth of 8 feet at the top&mdash;a vast amount of labor must have
been required to transport the material over so long and rough a road,
with no appliance more effective than human muscle. But the walls are
so well built that they are standing to-day, and from a secret crypt in
the wall of the south side of the <i>heiau</i> were taken but a few
years ago, and are still preserved, two finely-polished stone disks of
a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>diameter of eight or ten inches, which it is not
improbable were the two strange idols which tradition says Paao brought
with him over the great waters from Upolu, and which were hidden by
some faithful <i>kahu</i> or servant of the <i>heiau</i> when the
ancient worship of the people was abolished by the second Kamehameha in
1819.</p>
<p>Kanipahu was a just and considerate sovereign, and sought by every
peaceful means to harmonize the conflicting interests of the chiefs and
strengthen and consolidate his power. To this end, as already stated,
he allied himself by marriage to the Nanaula line of chiefs, and
attached to his person and household a number of prominent nobles of
native lineage. The result was that for some years he ruled in peace,
and race jealousies were gradually wearing away, when a circumstance
occurred which suddenly terminated the reign of Kanipahu and drove him
into exile.</p>
<p>It was a sultry afternoon, near the time of the annual feast of
<i>Lono</i>, perhaps in 1172, that Kanipahu, after having despatched
the business of the day, was reclining on a couch of mats in the cool
shade of a palm-grove within the walled enclosure of the palace
grounds&mdash;if, indeed, two large wooden and thatched buildings, each
a hundred or more feet in length by forty in breadth, with eight or ten
smaller houses among the banana growths in the rear, may be called a
palace. The grounds were thickly studded with shade and fruit trees,
embracing almost every variety of value found on the island. Here and
there were shaded walks and vine-wreathed nooks in which rude seats had
been constructed; and as the sentinels lounged lazily at the entrance,
and the <i>kahus</i> of the king languidly administered to his wants,
the scene was a picture of royal power and barbaric comfort peculiar to
the Polynesian islands, but scarcely less imposing than the forms and
architectural environments of the jarls and princes of northern and
central Europe at that period. Each of the personal attendants of the
king was of the lesser nobility, and his office was one of honor. Over
the head of the drowsing sovereign the <i>paakahili</i>, or
<i>kahili</i>-bearer, at brief intervals waved his tuft of painted
plumes, while at a respectful distance stood the spittoon-bearer
(<i>ipakuha</i>) and head steward (<i>aipuupuu</i>).</p>
<p>The king was suddenly aroused by a tumult at the outer <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>gate. There was a sound of angry voices mingled
with a clashing of spears, and immediately after a tall chief, clad in
<i>maro</i>, feather cape and helmet, and bearing a stout <i>ihe</i>,
or javelin, strode toward the royal mansion, followed by a number of
excited chiefs and their retainers. Reaching the palace, the chief
turned and faced his clamoring pursuers with a look of defiance. To
shed blood there was an offence which no one was bold or reckless
enough to commit, and, after one of the number had first been
despatched to the king to ascertain his pleasure, the entire party of
chiefs repaired to the royal presence, leaving their weapons behind in
the hands of the guards who had hurried toward the scene of
disturbance.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Type of Scenery&mdash;on the Road to Kilauea,
Hawaii.</p>
</div>
<p>Bowing low before the king, who had risen to a sitting posture on
his couch, the chiefs waited for him to break the silence. Slowly
scanning his auditors, all but one of whom he knew and trusted,
Kanipahu finally fixed his eyes upon the face of the stranger and
quietly said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your face is strange to me. Who are you, and what brings you
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great chief, I am Kamaiole, a chief of Kau,&rdquo; was the
reply, &ldquo;and I came to Kohala in search of my sister, Iola, who
was stolen and brought here about the close of the last season of
rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you found her?&rdquo; inquired the king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have found her,&rdquo; replied Kamaiole, bowing his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who took your sister away from Kau?&rdquo; resumed the
king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man,&rdquo; said Kamaiole, pointing to one of the chiefs
present; &ldquo;at least, so I presume, since he was seen in Kau about
the time of her disappearance, and I found her in his possession
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief designated was a large and well-favored young man, with a
palm-tree tattooed upon each of his muscular thighs, and wearing a
number of gaudy ornaments around his neck. He was an <i>alii koa</i>,
or military chief, without possessions and in the service of the king,
to whom he was distantly related. Turning toward him, Kanipahu
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, Waikuku, and answer the words of the chief of
Kau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glancing savagely at Kamaiole, Waikuku bowed to the king and
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true that Iola came with me from Kau, where I went
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>to visit the brother of my mother; but she came
willingly, although I admit without the consent of Kamaiole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waikuku is of the blood of noble chiefs,&rdquo; said the king
in a tone of conciliation; &ldquo;why not permit your sister, since it
is her will, to remain with him in peace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may remain,&rdquo; was Kamaiole&rsquo;s grim reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And well may she remain!&rdquo; exclaimed Waikuku bitterly.
&ldquo;Iola is dead! To-day, even a few breaths past, her brutal
brother found and with his own hand killed her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killed her?&rdquo; repeated the king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, killed her,&rdquo; continued Waikuku; &ldquo;and but
that her cowardly murderer sought the protection of the royal
enclosure, my spear would have tasted his blood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, and give good reason for this murder of the wife of
Waikuku,&rdquo; said the king, sternly addressing Kamaiole, &ldquo;or,
by great <i>Lono!</i> I will downward command your face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a prisoner of war or malefactor was brought before an ancient
Hawaiian king, if his order was &ldquo;Downward the face!&rdquo; the
prisoner was taken away and slain at once by one of the royal
executioners; but if it was &ldquo;Upward the face!&rdquo; his life was
spared, either for complete pardon, slavery or sacrifice to the
gods.</p>
<p>Giving little regard to the threat of the king, but burning with
wrath at the insulting language of Waikuku, Kamaiole proudly
answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am of the <i>aha-alii</i> of Hawaii. My war-canoes are red,
and pennons float at their mast-tips. The blood of Nanaula is in my
veins, and my ancestors were of the <i>alii-nui</i>&mdash;were kings
here generations before Pili landed at Kohala or the Paumakuas blasted
the shores of Hilo. With a rank befitting it was my purpose to mate my
sister. But she secretly became the wife of a marauding
<i>puuku</i>&mdash;possibly by force, probably by the charm of lies and
the glitter of shells&mdash;and I followed and slew her, that her blood
and mine might not be degraded by being mingled with that of
Waikuku!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Puuku!</i>&rdquo; hissed Waikuku, enraged at the low rank
contemptuously given him by Kamaiole, and making a hostile menace
toward the speaker.</p>
<p>Kamaiole regarded Waikuku for a moment with a look of disdain, and
then continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The occupation of this Waikuku&mdash;this
woman-stealer&mdash;is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href=
"#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>that of war, I have been informed.
He boasted that his spear would have tasted the blood of Kamaiole had
he not sought the protection of the royal grounds. I came here through
no fear of his arm or the spears of his friends, but to explain to the
king why I had shed blood within sight of the royal <i>hale</i>. But
since he talks so bravely of blood and spears, I challenge him to make
good his words with me beyond the palace walls. The matter is solely
between us. I am prepared to answer to him in words of combat for what
I have done to-day. Or if, as I suspect, he lacks the courage to give
his warlike training a test so public, I will ward a spear with such of
his friends, one by one, as may feel disposed to make his grievance
theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chiefs looked at each other in amazement at the broad challenge
of Kamaiole, and the king seemed to be scarcely less astounded. But the
proposal could not be deemed either unfair or unusual, since, according
to the usage of the time, Kamaiole was answerable to Waikuku for the
death of Iola.</p>
<p>The stinging remarks of the dauntless Kau chief left to Waikuku no
pretext or excuse for declining the challenge, and the king somewhat
reluctantly consented to a settlement of the matter by the arbitrament
of single combat, with such weapons as might be mutually agreed
upon.</p>
<p>Among the members of the royal household who witnessed this
remarkable interview with the king was a chief of the old native line
called Nanoa. Admiring the cool courage of Kamaiole, and feeling for
him something of a sympathy of lineage, he proffered to stand his
friend and adviser in the forthcoming encounter; and the arrangements
finally made were that the hostile parties were to meet just at sunset
in a grove immediately back of the palace enclosure. They were to be
armed each with two spears and a javelin. The spears were first to be
used when the combatants approached within twenty paces of each other.
These being thrown without ending the battle, the parties were to
advance to close encounter with their javelins, with the discretion of
either throwing or retaining them in hand. No other weapons were to be
used, and the conditions of the meeting were such that the king, who
proposed to be present, did not deem it probable that there would be
loss of life, especially as he had resolved to put an end to the combat
with the first wound received by either. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>Promptly at the time appointed the principals were on the ground.
The attendants of Kamaiole were nowhere to be seen. By his orders they
had quietly left the village two hours before, and the only friend at
his side was Nanoa. He had thrown aside his cloak and helmet, and stood
stern and motionless at the place assigned him, with a spear in his
right hand, and another, with a javelin, at his feet. With limbs and
shoulders bare, and beard and hair black as midnight veiling his neck,
Kamaiole leaned upon his spear a picture of barbaric strength and
courage.</p>
<p>Thirty paces in front of Kamaiole stood Waikuku, similarly armed and
clad, but less calm than his adversary. Around him were a score or more
of high chiefs, some rallying and others advising him; but he remained
gloomily silent, nervously awaiting the arrival of the king and the
word for action.</p>
<p>In a few minutes Kanipahu, accompanied by a number of armed
attendants, arrived and took a seat prepared for him at a point about
equally distant from the two combatants. It being announced that
everything was in readiness, the king signaled the word to be given,
and the hostile chiefs, advancing five paces each, were in a moment
balancing their long spears for flight. The spear of Waikuku first shot
through the air in a line direct for his adversary&rsquo;s breast; but
the latter adroitly turned it from its course with a touch from his own
weapon, which he in turn launched at Waikuku without effect. The second
spears were thrown to the injury of neither, when they grasped their
javelins and slowly and warily began to advance. It was an exciting
moment. As each had gripped his weapon with both hands, it was apparent
that neither <i>ihe</i> would be thrown, and a hand-to-hand struggle
was inevitable.</p>
<p>The king drew nearer to obtain a better view of the closing
conflict, and the spectators eagerly watched every movement of the
advancing chiefs. Approaching within striking distance&mdash;the
javelins being about six feet in length&mdash;a few feints were made,
and Waikuku ventured a desperate thrust at the breast of his opponent.
The movement was evidently expected, perhaps invited, for like a flash
the point of the <i>ihe</i> was thrown into the air, and the next
moment Waikuku received a thrust through the side. He fell, javelin in
hand, and Kamaiole was lifting his weapon to strike his prostrate enemy
to the heart when &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; came the command of the king.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span></p>
<p>Heedless of the royal order, or too greatly excited to be able to
restrain his hand, Kamaiole savagely drove his javelin into the breast
of Waikuku, inflicting a death-wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Downward the face!&rdquo; thundered the king, exasperated at
Kamaiole&rsquo;s apparent defiance of his order.</p>
<p>The chiefs began to move forward to seize or slay the offender.
Knowing that his death had been decreed, Kamaiole recklessly poised his
<i>ihe</i>, red with the life-blood of Waikuku, and with a wild cry of
&ldquo;Yes, downward the face!&rdquo; hurled it at the heart of
Kanipahu.</p>
<p>With exclamations of rage and horror the spectators sprang toward
Kamaiole, the most of them dropping their unwieldy spears and grasping
their <i>pahoas</i>, or daggers of ivory or hardened wood, as they
advanced.</p>
<p>For an instant Kamaiole hesitated whether to defend himself to the
death with the javelin of the dying chief, or take the almost equally
desperate chances of escape by breaking through the lines of his
encircling enemies. He chose the latter, and, grasping the javelin,
started toward the king, with the view of drawing his assailants in
that direction. This object being accomplished, he suddenly turned to
the right, and charged and made an opening through the throng at a
point that seemed to be the weakest. As he flew past the yielding line
he miraculously escaped the spear and knife thrusts aimed at him, and
succeeded in putting himself beyond the reach of spear and sling before
real pursuit was made.</p>
<p>The javelin hurled at the king was received in the shoulder of a
faithful attendant who had opportunely thrown himself in front of his
royal master; and so rapid and confusing were the movements following
that Kanipahu had scarcely recovered from his consternation at the bold
assault upon his life before he learned that Kamaiole had escaped.
Giving orders for a vigorous pursuit of the fugitive, the king walked
to the body of Waikuku, and, discovering that life was extinct,
directed its respectful removal, and then proceeded sadly to the royal
mansion.</p>
<p>Kamaiole was not overtaken. He was strong and fleet of foot, and, as
darkness soon intervened in his favor, he was able to elude his
pursuers. He reached the coast in safety, and, boarding a canoe
awaiting him in charge of his attendants, set sail for Kau. This
provision for a hasty flight from Kohala renders it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>certain that Kamaiole meditated desperate work
on landing there, and the relation of his subsequent exploits has shown
how successfully he performed it.</p>
</div>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Kamaiole supposed he had killed his sister, and
Waikuku, who had seen her just before his unfortunate encounter,
thought she had but a few minutes to live; but the wounds inflicted did
not prove fatal, and Iola finally recovered and became the mother of a
daughter to her dead husband. Tradition attributes her recovery to the
especial prayers of the high-priest, but careful nursing and a good
constitution were probably the saving means, assisted by the fortunate
escape of the vital organs from serious injury.</p>
<p>Returning to Kau, Kamaiole began to prepare for war at once, not
doubting that Kanipahu, defied and assaulted at the very gates of the
royal mansion, would feel it his duty to bring him to submission.
Sending emissaries through the several districts, he appealed to the
native chiefs and people to join him in a revolt against Kanipahu, for
the purpose of transferring the sovereignty of the island to a ruler of
the old Nanaula line, and restoring to them the simple worship of their
fathers and the possessions of which they had been despoiled by the
southern invaders.</p>
<p>The appeal was not without effect. Substantial aid was promised in
Kona, Kau, Puna and Hilo, and in less than three months Kamaiole found
himself at the head of an army large enough not only to protect him at
Kau, which was doubtless the original purpose of the movement, but to
carry the war into Kohala and effect a general revolution.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the plans of Kanipahu concerning the
rebellious Kau chief, he certainly seemed to be in no haste to put them
in execution, for when Kamaiole arrived in Kohala at the head of his
forces he was but feebly opposed. Tradition fails to account for the
apathy of Kanipahu in the face of the supreme danger confronting him.
All we are told is that, finding it impossible to raise an army strong
enough to suppress the formidable revolt, he left his sons with a
trusted friend in the valley of Waimanu, in the district of Hamakua,
and sought refuge for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href=
"#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>himself on the island of Molokai.
Iola, fearing to meet her brother, or that he might learn that she
still lived, also found an asylum with the young sons of Kanipahu in
the secluded valley of Waimanu.</p>
<p>Thus Kamaiole assumed the sovereignty of Hawaii almost without
opposition, and Kanipahu lived quietly and unknown at Kalae, on the
small island of Molokai. He dressed and comported himself as a simple
commoner, performing his own work, bearing his own burdens, and
accepting all the hardships to which the poor and untitled were
subject. He won the love of his neighbors for his kindness, and on two
occasions took up arms to assist them in repelling plundering raids
from Maui; and so well did he use his weapons that his humble friends
were astonished, and thought he must have been trained in the arts of
war, even if he was not of chiefly blood. It is well known that the
chiefs, as a class, were physically larger than the masses, so much so
that they claimed, and still claim, a descent distinct from that of the
common people. Kanipahu was nearer seven than six feet in height, and
his size was suggestive of rank; but he habitually stooped his head and
shoulders, that his height might be subject to less remark, and labored
more industriously than any of his neighbors in order to convince them
that he was reared to toil. And in the end, as the years came and went,
toil became a comfort to him, for it occupied his thoughts and gave him
dreamless and refreshing slumber.</p>
<p>Let us now pass over a period of eighteen years from the accession
of Kamaiole to the sovereignty of Hawaii. Kanipahu was still a laborer
on the island of Molokai, and his sons had grown to manhood in the
secluded valley of Waimanu, their rank and family ties known only to a
few who could be trusted. One of these sons was Kalapana, and he had
married Makea, the daughter of Iola. Her father was the dead Waikuku,
and her uncle was Kamaiole, the <i>moi</i> of Hawaii.</p>
<p>Kamaiole&rsquo;s reign had been eighteen years of almost continual
domestic turmoil and popular dissatisfaction. He was cruel, selfish and
arrogant; but he was also a cool and sagacious soldier, and his craft
and courage had thus far enabled him to thwart the organization of
discontent and enforce obedience to his authority. He had even
succeeded in securing the allegiance of every prominent chief in the
six districts of Hawaii&mdash;a political condition <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>such
as had never before been achieved by any of his predecessors.</p>
<p>Wide-spread changes in feudatory tenures were the principal causes
of internal trouble. Under the Pili dynasty the land boundaries of the
native chiefs had been greatly shifted and narrowed to make room for
the chiefs of the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i>. In attempting to restore
the old feudal boundaries as far as possible, and adjust the new,
Kamaiole had not only stirred up bitter strifes among the nobles, but
had unwittingly disturbed the vassalage of the masses and thereby
rendered all classes restless and distrustful.</p>
<p>Finally the discontent became so general among the <i>makaainana</i>
that they appealed to the head of the Paao family, the high-priest of
the kingdom, for advice and assistance. They declared that they would
no longer submit to the tyranny of Kamaiole and the exactions of his
favored chiefs, and demanded a new ruler. Tradition ascribes this
movement almost wholly to the laboring people, but it is more than
probable that the priesthood took an early if not the initiatory part
in it, since the high-priest seems to have known that Kanipahu was
still living, and at once despatched a messenger to Molokai, informing
the exiled king that the people were ripe for rebellion, and advising
him to repair to Hawaii at once and place himself at the head of the
discontented thousands who would rejoice at his coming. Fearful of
treachery, Kanipahu declined to make any promises to the messenger,
and, in disguise, the high-priest himself proceeded to Kalae and urged
the old chief to return and reassert his authority on Hawaii.</p>
<p>Kanipahu was profoundly moved at the words of the high-priest, and
no longer doubted the sincerity and good faith of the tempting offer;
but he declined to accept it, and, when urged for the reasons, rose
sadly to his feet and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at these hands, hardened and crooked with toil; look at
this face, begrimed and wrinkled with exposure to the sun and rain;
behold my bent head, and the unsightly hump that old age and stooping
labor have placed upon my shoulders! Is this the figure of a king? No!
The <i>oo</i> better becomes the hand of Kanipahu now than the staff of
sovereignty. Here have I contentedly dwelt for many years, and here it
is my will to peacefully die.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then are we without hope,&rdquo; replied the priest, in a
tone of unfeigned sadness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not without hope,&rdquo; returned Kanipahu. &ldquo;My
sons are in the valley of Waimanu. I have heard from them many times.
They are worthy of their blood. Seek out Kalapana. He is brave, manly,
sagacious. Tell him that upon his shoulders Kanipahu, his father,
places the burden of the war against Kamaiole, and in advance bequeaths
to him all his valor may win, even the sovereignty of
Hawaii.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, great chief!&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;We
are not without hope. Kalapana shall answer for his father, and from
every <i>heiau</i> in Hawaii shall prayers be spoken for his
success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest received the directions necessary to enable him to
communicate with the sons of Kanipahu, and secretly returned to Hawaii
to fan the smouldering fires of rebellion and prepare for the coming
struggle.</p>
<p>Although the high-priesthood had become too firmly established in
the Paao family to be changed by Kamaiole, he could not disguise his
dislike for the innovations made by the southern line upon the simpler
worship of his fathers, and neither confidence nor cordiality existed
between the political and religious authorities. The rebellion against
Kamaiole was therefore secretly but earnestly assisted by the entire
priesthood, and when Kalapana raised the standard of revolt the people
flocked to his support by thousands.</p>
<p>The rebellion was organized with extraordinary rapidity, and when
Kalapana suddenly made his appearance in Kohala at the head of a large
army, Kamaiole was in no condition to meet him. He hurriedly despatched
his <i>lunapais</i>, or war-messengers, to the chiefs of Kohala, Kona,
Hamakua and Hilo, commanding their prompt assistance, and summoned the
priests and diviners of the <i>heiau</i> of Mookini to make unusual
sacrifices to the gods and to bring him at once the auguries of the
uprising. But the chiefs responded with no alacrity to his call, and
the diviners informed him that triumph to his arms was possible only in
Kona. Kamaiole therefore abandoned Kohala, and, with such force as he
was able to assemble, fell back into North Kona, where the quotas of
warriors from the neighboring districts were ordered to join him.</p>
<p>Amidst great popular enthusiasm Kalapana marched into <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>Northern Kohala without opposition, and took
possession of the royal mansion from which his father had been driven
into exile eighteen years before. Kanipahu had not overestimated the
capacity of his son. By instinct he was a soldier, and from the moment
that he appeared at the head of his army the chiefs who had been
rallied to his support by the priesthood saw that the quiet and dreamy
recluse of Waimanu was made to command; and their enthusiasm in his
cause, which was soon shared by the people, made easy his way to
victory.</p>
<p>Learning that Kamaiole had fallen back into Kona, Kalapana resolved
to follow him without delay, and, if possible, bring him to battle
before reinforcements could reach him from the south. The auguries were
more than favorable. They were not even ambiguous. They expressly
declared that Kamaiole would be killed in Kona. It was, therefore, with
confidence and enthusiasm that Kalapana and his steadily increasing
army started on their march for the adjoining district of Kona.</p>
<p>Meantime Kamaiole was not inactive. He had succeeded in gathering a
force of eight thousand men, and, learning that Kalapana was advancing
from Kohala, resolved to give him battle at a place called Anaehoomalu,
not far from the northern line of Kona. The point was selected for its
strategical advantages, and there Kamaiole, doubtful of the
result&mdash;for he could see that the tide had set in against
him&mdash;determined to end the struggle.</p>
<p>There was but a two days&rsquo; march between the hostile camps, and
Kalapana pushed forward with cautious haste. The priests and
<i>kaulas</i> had promised him success, and the most influential chiefs
of Hamakua and Kohala were at his side. He had brought with him from
Waimanu, where it had been secreted for eighteen years, the war-god of
Pili, which had been redecorated, and was borne in front of him in
charge of the high-priest. And with him, to share his fate, went his
young wife, Makea, to care for him if wounded, to fight by his side,
perhaps, should the tide of battle turn against him; for at that time,
and later, the more courageous of the wives and daughters of the chiefs
not unfrequently, in emergencies, took an active part in the field.</p>
<p>On the morning of the third day after Kalapana&rsquo;s departure
from Kohala the two armies confronted each other, and Kalapana
immediately organized his forces for battle. Kamaiole saw that he was
outnumbered, and resolved to await the attack behind <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>his
defences. In the face of the great odds against him in numbers he was
by no means hopeful; and, besides, the auguries were unsatisfactory,
and three times the night before he had heard the scream of the
<i>alae</i>, the bird of evil omen. But no feeling of fear affected
him. Filled with gloomy courage, he cheered his warriors with promises
of victory, and, armed with a javelin and heavy <i>laau-palau</i>, or
rude halberd, placed himself at the most exposed point of his defences
and awaited the attack.</p>
<p>The battle opened, and with a wild rush a heavy division of
Kalapana&rsquo;s forces, armed with spears, clubs, and stone axes, was
hurled against the rough stone wall, four or five feet in height,
behind which the enemy found partial protection. The wall was leveled
in places, and desperate hand-to-hand conflicts followed, but the
assault was finally repulsed. Rallied and reinforced, a second charge
was made, but with no better success. The loss of life was great, and
the result began to look doubtful.</p>
<p>But Kalapana was not discouraged by these costly failures.
Withdrawing and strengthening the attacking division, and announcing
that he would lead the next assault in person, he ordered an attack in
the rear of the enemy by his entire reserve. This involved a rapid
march of two or three miles, and the passage of a deep ravine which
Kamaiole relied upon as a complete defence of his right flank. While
this movement was being executed Kalapana kept the enemy employed with
heavy lines of skirmishers and frequent menaces of more decided
assault.</p>
<p>For more than an hour this desultory fighting continued, Kalapana
impatiently watching for the appearance of his flanking column on the
hill above the enemy. At length he discovered the first of its
advancing spears, and a few minutes later the entire body came into
view and began to pour down the slope. The final assault in front was
then ordered, Kalapana taking command in person.</p>
<p>The sudden attack in the rear carried consternation to
Kamaiole&rsquo;s warriors; but their undaunted leader coolly and
resolutely prepared for the worst. Hastily taking from the front
defences such spears as could be spared, he summoned the entire
reserve, and with the united force sprang like a lion to meet the
attack from the hill. It came like an avalanche and could not be
stayed. The struggle was desperate. As his warriors fell on every side
of him, Kamaiole moved like a tower of destruction <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>through the conflict. He seemed to bear a
charmed life, and men fell like grass before the sweep of his
<i>laau-palau</i>.</p>
<p>Suddenly an old man of large mould, with head bent and long, white
hair and beard sweeping his breast and stooping shoulders, stepped in
front of Kamaiole, and with a heavy spear-pointed club calmly but
dexterously warded a blow of the terrible <i>laau-palau</i> aimed at
his head, and, answering quick as thought, felled the royal warrior to
the earth like a forest tree. Around and over the body of the fallen
chief a desperate struggle ensued. But it was of short duration. Under
the command of Kalapana the front defences had been carried, and such
of the royal army as had escaped slaughter were soon wildly leaping
over the walls and retreating in confusion in all directions.</p>
<p>Pressing toward the rear at the head of his victorious warriors,
Kalapana was attracted to the fierce hand-to-hand conflict taking place
over the body of Kamaiole. Without stopping to inquire the cause, he
promptly plunged into the thickest of the combat, backed by a few
resolute followers, and speedily relieved the old white-haired warrior
from a struggle which was taxing his strength to the utmost. This was
the last stand made by the enemy in a body; what remained of the battle
was a merciless massacre of the wounded, and the capture and retention
alive of a few prisoners for sacrifice.</p>
<p>Resting for a moment and taking a survey of the field,
Kalapana&rsquo;s eyes fell upon the old warrior. With one foot upon the
breast of Kamaiole, he was leaning upon his war-club and scanning the
face of Kalapana. His ponderous weapon still dripped with gore, and his
wrinkled face was splashed with the blood of his enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Kamaiole?&rdquo; suddenly inquired Kalapana,
grasping his weapon, as if his work of death had not yet been finished.
&ldquo;Where is Kamaiole?&rdquo; he repeated to those around him.
&ldquo;Who has seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is Kamaiole,&rdquo; replied the old warrior, pointing
with bloody finger to the face of the dying king.</p>
<p>Kalapana abruptly turned, and for a moment gazed in silence upon the
face of his fallen enemy. Although wounded to the death, Kamaiole was
still living, and his eyes showed that he was conscious of what was
transpiring around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whose hand did he fall?&rdquo; inquired Kalapana.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;By mine,&rdquo; briefly answered the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who are you?&rdquo; continued Kalapana, with something of
a feeling of awe, &ldquo;who have thus come unsummoned, in the guise of
a god from our sacred temples, to strike for the son of
Kanipahu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man slowly raised his head, and, brushing back the white
hairs from his face, was about to speak, when the high-priest, with
<i>kahus</i> bearing the war-god of Kalapana, approached to greet his
victorious chief. Recognizing the venerable warrior, the astounded
high-priest dropped on his knees before him, exclaiming,
&ldquo;Kanipahu! Kanipahu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost in a dream, Kalapana, making himself known, embraced his
father, whom he had not seen for eighteen years, and then respectfully
chided him for coming secretly from Molokai and joining the army as a
common warrior, when his rank and abilities entitled him to supreme
command.</p>
<p>The old chief smiled sadly as he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The purpose of my coming has been accomplished. With my own
hand I have answered in blood to the treachery of Kamaiole, and paid
him for the hump he has placed upon my shoulders. I shall return to
Molokai, and there the old hunchback will spend his few remaining days
in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words were heard and doubtless understood by Kamaiole, for he
closed his eyes, and a smile of defiance played for a moment about his
lips.</p>
<p>Just then Makea joined her husband, and was overjoyed to find him
victorious and unhurt. With the first lull of battle she had started in
search of him with a calabash of water, and to reach him had been
compelled to pick her way through ghastly heaps of dead. At the sound
of her voice, sweetly replacing the din of battle, Kamaiole opened his
eyes and fixed his gaze upon her face. Finally his lips moved as if he
would speak. Instinctively she approached the dying chief, and,
kneeling, poured into his open mouth a few swallows of water.</p>
<p>Kalapana turned and smiled at Makea&rsquo;s humanity, unusual on
barbarous battle-fields. A grateful look came into the eyes of
Kamaiole, and with a questioning glance he faintly syllabled
&ldquo;Iola!&rdquo; the name of his sister, and the mother of Makea,
whom she closely resembled. Kalapana caught the word, and,
understanding its meaning, in a tone not far from kind replied:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not Iola, your sister, whom you failed to kill, but
Makea, her daughter, who is Kalapana&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kamaiole convulsively raised his head and arms&mdash;whether in a
spirit of rage or conciliation will never be known&mdash;and then
dropped back dead.</p>
<p>The remainder of the story may be briefly told. In disregard of all
persuasion, Kanipahu returned at once to Molokai, where he lived and
died in obscurity, earning his own living and assuming no rank.</p>
<p>Kalapana was anointed king of Hawaii on his return to Kohala, and a
hundred prisoners were sacrificed to the gods at Mookini. His reign was
conciliatory and peaceful, and with Makea, whose full name was
Makeamalamaihanae, he became the ancestor of Kamehameha the Great.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Tradition abounds in bold outlines, here and there
interspersed with curious details, of the many prominent expeditions to
the Hawaiian Islands, from the beginning of the eleventh to the latter
part of the twelfth centuries, of adventurous Tahitian, Samoan and
Georgian chiefs. Learning of the existence and approximate location of
the group, and perhaps guided to an extent by intervening islands and
atolls that have since disappeared, they came with large fleets of
barges and double canoes, bearing their families and attendants, their
priests, astrologers and musicians, and by degrees possessed themselves
or their immediate descendants with the fairest portions of the little
archipelago. For a century or more bitter feuds and frequent wars
followed; but in the end the invaders and the invaded, both of the same
Polynesian race, became assimilated through concession, intermarriage
and fundamental identity of religious cult, and thenceforth in a united
and homogeneous stream flowed down the years. The genealogies of the
prominent chiefs and priests were alone preserved; and while, in
after-generations, some of them traced their lines of rank to the
native stock of Nanaula, and others to the chiefs of the second
migratory influx from the south, the ruling families of the entire
group had become so united in blood by intermarriage that it was
difficult to find a chief of distinction who could not trace his
lineage back to both.</p>
<p>But during the migratory period referred to, especially marked by
the coming of Nanamaoa, Pili, Paao and the Oahu and Maui Paumakuas, the
Hawaiian group was not the only scene of foreign adventure among the
central islands of the Pacific. The native chiefs of Hawaii, whose
ancestors had reached the group more <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>than five hundred
years before, were quite as adventurous and skilled in navigation as
their southern invaders; and thus while the latter, continually
augmented in numbers by fresh arrivals, were steadily possessing
themselves of the lands and governing forces of the Hawaiian Islands, a
few resolute chiefs of the old line, either in a spirit of retaliation
or because the way had been pointed out, boldly spread their sails for
the abandoned homes of their aggressors, and by conquest or other means
acquired lands and influence in the distant islands of the south.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The Pali, near Honolulu.</p>
</div>
<p>The <i>mooolelo</i> about to be related embraces the romantic story
of one of these expeditions of native Hawaiian chiefs to the southern
islands, and presents an interesting picture of the manners, customs
and aspirations of the mid-Pacific Argonauts of that period.</p>
<p>Somewhere about the year <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1040 Maweke, a
native chief of the line of Nanaula&mdash;the first of the family that
is brought prominently to view in the chronology of the second
influx&mdash;was the <i>alii-nui</i>, or nominal sovereign, of the
island of Oahu. He had three sons&mdash;Mulielealii, Keaunui and
Kalehenui. On the death of Maweke, the eldest son, Mulielealii, acceded
to the title of <i>alii-nui</i>, occupying the western side of the
island. Kalehenui was given possessions at Koolau, and Keaunui was
established in the district of Ewa. The latter became the ancestor of a
line of powerful chiefs in that district, and is credited with having
cut or opened the navigable channel near the Puuloa salt-works, by
which the estuary now known as Pearl River, not far from Honolulu, was
rendered accessible to navigation. No further reference need here be
made to this branch of the family beyond the remark that Keaunui became
the father of Lakona, and also of Nuakea, the wife of Keoloewa, King of
Molokai, and of the prophet Moi, who fell with Kaupeepee in defence of
the fortress of Haupu, as related in the legend of &ldquo;<i>Hina, the
Helen of Hawaii</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mulielealii had three sons&mdash;Kumuhonua, Olopana and
Moikeha&mdash;and one daughter, named Hainakolo. As the eldest son and
successor of his father, Kumuhonua in time acceded to the patrimonial
estates and titles; but the younger brothers, not content, as they grew
to manhood, with the small allotments which must necessarily have been
accorded them, concluded to seek for ampler and more inviting
possessions elsewhere. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href=
"#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Paumakua family occupied a large part of the eastern side of the
island, and, although they were of the stock of the second influx,
their relations with the native chiefs and people seem to have been
peaceful and satisfactory. Paumakua, who first appeared in native
annals two generations before the time of Olopana and his brothers,
either as an immigrant from one of the southern islands or the son or
grandson of a chief of recent arrival, was one of the most restless and
dashing of the prominent leaders of that period. The legends of the
time glow with stories of his marvellous exploits and adventures in
foreign lands, and the friendly feeling entertained for his immediate
successors was doubtless due in a great measure to the respect
established for them through his rank and prowess.</p>
<p>It is claimed by tradition that Paumakua visited all the foreign
lands then known to the Hawaiians, and brought back with him many
things that were strange. From one of his voyages he returned with two
white priests, Keakea and Maliu, from whom several ecclesiastical
families subsequently claimed descent and authority. At another time he
brought back Malela, a noted prophet and sorcerer, and three other
persons of a strange race, one of whom was a woman. Tradition somewhat
minutely describes them as &ldquo;foreigners of large stature, bright,
staring, roguish eyes, and reddish faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the voyages of this adventurous chief were sometimes of many
months&rsquo; duration, and he is said to have prosecuted his
researches in almost every direction, it is not impossible that the
foreigners with &ldquo;roguish eyes and reddish faces&rdquo; were
aborigines of North America. But, leaving this to conjecture, tradition
permits no doubt that Paumakua was a skilful and fearless explorer, and
through his enterprise acquired renown for himself and respect for his
descendants, one of whom is about to be presented to the reader.</p>
<p>As already stated, the younger sons of Mulielealii, Olopana and
Moikeha, not content with their prospects in Oahu, resolved to seek
fame and fortune elsewhere. Both were unmarried, but, through some
circumstance or for some purpose not mentioned by tradition, Moikeha
had adopted a young son of Ahukai, the great-grandson and successor of
Paumakua. The name of the boy was Laa, or Laa-mai-kahiki, to which it
was subsequently extended. The child-chief could not have been without
political <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>prospects, for he is referred to in the chants
as &ldquo;Chief of Kapaahu and Lord of Nualaka.&rdquo; Although the
custom was common then, as now, among Hawaiians of every rank and
condition, of exchanging and adopting children, the adoption of so
promising a scion of the Paumakua line by a grandson of Maweke must
have been the result of some extraordinary compact, all reference to
which has disappeared from tradition.</p>
<p>Taking leave of their relatives on Oahu, Olopana and Moikeha, with a
considerable number of attendants, embarked for the island of Hawaii,
and established themselves at once in the beautiful valley of Waipio,
in the district of Hamakua. What chief, if any, they found in
possession there is not stated; but it was not long before the valley
was ruled by Olopana, with Moikeha as his principal captain and
adviser. The young chief Laa accompanied his foster-father to Waipio,
and there Moikeha began to instruct him in the manly accomplishments
for which in after-years he became distinguished.</p>
<p>To strengthen his rule and protect himself against the encroachments
of neighboring chiefs, Olopana married Luukia, granddaughter of
Hikapaloa, chief of Kohala, and a descendant of the ancient line of
Nanaula, to which Olopana himself belonged by lineage still more
direct. He urged his brother to follow his example and connect himself
by marriage with some one of the ruling families of Hamakua. Such an
alliance could have been readily made by Moikeha, for his strain was
undoubted, and in manly beauty and courtly graces he had scarcely a
peer in all the group; but he declared that he had a wife in his spear
and an heir in Laa, and would not create a jealousy in the family by
adding to either.</p>
<p>But the brothers did not remain long in Waipio. A terrible
hurricane, followed by storms and floods, completely devastated the
valley, compelling the inhabitants to abandon their homes and seek
refuge elsewhere. Moikeha had never been satisfied with Waipio, and in
the midst of the ruin around them found little difficulty in persuading
his brother to make a bold push for the misty and far-off land of
Kahiki. Preparations for the journey were immediately made, and in five
large double canoes the brothers, with Laa and a considerable body of
attendants, set sail for the islands of the south. They knew the
general direction, and the sun and stars guided them in their course.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>A prosperous wind wafted them to the Society group, and they finally
landed on the island of Raiatea, and forcibly took, or in some other
manner secured, possession of the district of Moaula. Olopana was
accepted as sovereign of the district, and soon became a ruler of
opulence and distinction. Moikeha, still his chief adviser, built a
sumptuous residence and <i>heiau</i> for himself, called
<i>Lanikeha</i>, or &ldquo;the heavenly resting-place,&rdquo; and
became noted for his hospitality.</p>
<p>For some time&mdash;perhaps for four or five years&mdash;the
brothers dwelt together in harmony, and then misunderstanding and
trouble came between them&mdash;it need scarcely be said, through a
woman&mdash;which drove Moikeha again to the sea and separated them for
ever. A meddlesome native chief named Mua, who was jealous of the
popularity of Moikeha and desirous of supplanting him in the favor of
Olopana, called the attention of Luukia on several occasions to
Moikeha&rsquo;s affluent style of living, and intimated that his
purpose was to thereby secure the friendship of influential chiefs, and
in the end wrest the sovereignty of the district from his brother.
Alarmed at last, she bore the tale to her husband, and at length
succeeded in arousing his suspicions. A coldness toward Moikeha very
naturally followed. Olopana could not help but note his brother&rsquo;s
increasing popularity, and one day took occasion to rebuke him for his
extravagance and love of display, suggesting, at the same time, that a
more modest style of living would comport better with his position.
Moikeha, who had never harbored a thought that was not loyal to his
brother, was profoundly grieved at these words of suspicion, and
resolved to leave Raiatea at once and return to the Hawaiian Islands.
Feeling that he had gone too far in thus indirectly accusing his
brother of meditated treachery, Olopana endeavored to persuade him to
remain; but Moikeha&rsquo;s resolution could not be shaken, and he set
about preparing at once for his return to the Hawaiian group.</p>
<p>The number of canoes manned and provisioned for the voyage is not
stated; but tradition avers that the fleet was equipped under the
superintendence of Moikeha&rsquo;s famous prophet and astrologer,
Kamahualele; and, with the priest Mookini, Laamaomao, the director of
the winds, and a large party of chiefs and retainers, the expedition
set sail for Hawaii, the young chief Laa being left behind with
Olopana. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was one of the most imposing fleets that had ever sailed out of
the harbor of Opoa. The large double canoe bearing Moikeha and his
priests, gods, astrologer, principal navigator, wind director and
personal attendants, was the same in which he had sailed for Kahiki.
The <i>kaulua</i> was nearly a hundred feet in length, and afforded
ample accommodations for the forty or more persons assigned to it. It
was painted red, and at the masthead floated the pennon of a Polynesian
<i>alii</i>.</p>
<p>Moikeha embarked with a number of distinguished companions, but the
most noted was Laamaomao&mdash;a name signifying, perhaps, the sacred
bluish green or wind clouds. He was the director of the winds, which
were stored in his <i>ipu</i>, or calabash, and went forth at his
bidding. He bore a close resemblance to the &AElig;olus of the Greeks.
After accompanying Moikeha to the Hawaiian Islands he took up his abode
near a place called Hale-a-Lono, a well-known eminence of Kaluakoi, on
the island of Molokai, and was subsequently deified and worshipped as
an <i>aumakua</i>, or god of the winds.</p>
<p>With musicians and drummers to enliven the spirits of the voyagers,
and favoring winds from the <i>ipu</i> of Laamaomao, the journey seems
to have been prosperous, and no incident of note occurred until the
island of Hawaii was sighted. As the green hills of Kau came to view
songs and shouts of joy went up from the canoes. A voyage of over
twenty-five hundred miles in open boats had tested the patience of the
party, and land at last was a joyous sight to them all. Many leaped
into the water and swam beside the canoes. Mookini, the high-priest,
burned incense before the gods, at the same time addressing them a
prayer of thanksgiving, and Kamahualele, the astrologer and poet,
recited an inspiring chant in further celebration of the occasion. The
chant has been preserved by tradition.</p>
<p>Some of the early poetic accounts of the first appearance of the
islands of Hawaii above the surface of the ocean mention Hawaii, the
largest of the group, as suddenly rising from the great deep and
becoming a part of a row or cluster of islands &ldquo;stretching to the
farthest ends of Kahiki,&rdquo; from which it is conjectured that,
centuries back in the past, islands now no longer existing marked the
way at intervals between the Society and Hawaiian groups. The other
islands of the Hawaiian cluster are referred to as natural births,
their parents being demi-gods <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123"
href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>or distinguished chiefs.
Thus, in the language of an old chant:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Rising up is Hawaii-nui-akea!</p>
<p class="line">Rising up out of the night (<i>Po</i>)!</p>
<p class="line">Appeared has the island, the land,</p>
<p class="line">The string of islands of Nuuamea,</p>
<p class="line">The cluster of islands stretching to the farthest ends
of Kahiki.</p>
<p class="line">To Kuluwaiea of Haumea, the husband,</p>
<p class="line">To Hina-nui-a-lana, the wife,</p>
<p class="line">Was born Molokai, a god, a priest,</p>
<p class="line">The first morning light from Nuuamea.</p>
<p class="line">Up stands Akuhinialaa,</p>
<p class="line">The chief from the foreign land;</p>
<p class="line">From the gills of the fish</p>
<p class="line">From the overwhelming billows of Halehale-kalani,</p>
<p class="line">Born is Oahu, the <i>wohi</i>,</p>
<p class="line">The <i>wohi</i> of Akuhinialaa,</p>
<p class="line">And of Laamealaakona the wife.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Kamahualele began by repeating an ancient story of the
origin of the several islands of the group, and concluded his chant
with these hopeful words:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;O Haumea Manukahikele.</p>
<p class="line">O Moikeha, the chief who is to reside,</p>
<p class="line">My chief will reside on Hawaii&mdash;a!</p>
<p class="line">Life, life, O buoyant life!</p>
<p class="line">Live shall the chief and priest,</p>
<p class="line">Live shall the seer and the slave,</p>
<p class="line">Dwell on Hawaii and be at rest,</p>

<h3 class="main">II.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The prediction of Kamahualele, inspired by a sudden
view of the coast of Hawaii, was verified. A landing was made in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>district of Kau, the most southerly point of the
island. There securing supplies of provisions and water, the next
landing was effected at Cape Kumukahi, in the district of Puna; but a
recent eruption from the crater of Kilauea, or a subterranean channel
connected with it, had devastated a wide strip of country near the
coast, and after a brief stay sail was made for Kohala. Landing in that
district, Moikeha and his party were well received by Kaniuhi, the
<i>alii-nui</i> and grandson of Pili, and permission to offer
sacrifices in behalf of the expedition in the great <i>heiau</i> of
Mookini was accorded the high-priest of Moikeha, whose name, by
singular coincidence, was identical with that of the temple, erected by
the high-priest Paao more than two generations before.</p>
<p>Leaving Kohala, Moikeha next touched at Hanuaula, on the island of
Maui; but, without stopping to exchange courtesies with Haho, the noted
<i>moi</i> of that division of the island, he sailed immediately for
Oahu. His purpose was to visit his royal father, Mulielealii, whose
residence was at Ewa; but his priest and seer so strongly protested
against the visit, declaring it to be contrary to the will of the gods,
that he directed his course around the northern side of the island,
touching at Makapuu and Makaaoa, and then sailing directly for the
island of Kauai.</p>
<p>On the evening of the second day after leaving Oahu, Moikeha
anchored his canoes in a roadstead not far from Kapaa, Kauai, where
Puna, the governing <i>alii</i> of the island, held his court,
surrounded by the chiefs of his family and a large number of retainers.
Puna was one of the most popular rulers in the group, and, strict as he
may have been in the exercise of his prerogatives, was always merciful
in dealing with offences thoughtlessly or ignorantly committed. He
would pardon the humble laborer who might inadvertently cross his
shadow or violate a <i>tabu</i>, but never the chief who deliberately
trespassed upon his privileges or withheld a courtesy due to his rank.
His disposition was naturally warlike, but as the condition of the
island was peaceful, and military force was seldom required except in
repelling occasional plundering raids from the other islands, he kept
alive the martial spirit of his chiefs and subjects by frequent sham
fights, marine drills, and the encouragement of athletic games and
friendly contests at arms, in which he himself sometimes took part.
Feasting and dancing usually followed these <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>warlike pastimes, and the result was that the
court of Puna became somewhat noted for the chivalry of its chiefs and
the splendor of its entertainments.</p>
<p>Puna had but one child, a daughter named Hooipo. Tradition describes
her as having been, like the most of royal daughters painted by the
poets, a very comely maiden. She was therefore the pride and glory of
the court, and as she grew to a marriageable age her favor was sought
by a number of aspiring chiefs whose rank entitled them to
consideration; but, flattered by the contest for her smiles, and
naturally vain of a face which the unruffled waters told her was
attractive, she evinced no haste in making choice of a husband.</p>
<p>This tardiness or indecision was but very gently rebuked by Puna.
Although one tradition gives him two daughters, Hooipo was doubtless
his only child, and he was therefore indisposed to hasten an event
which would probably lead to their separation. But, as time passed, the
suitors of the young chiefess became so persistent, and the rivalry for
her assumed so bitter and warlike an aspect, that Puna deemed it
prudent for her to restore harmony among the rivals by making a choice
at once. But for no one of them did she seem to entertain a decided
preference, and therefore suggested that, since a choice must be made,
she was willing to leave it to the arbitrament of such manly contest
between the rivals as might comport with their dignity and the
character of the prize at stake. Puna eagerly accepted the suggestion,
as it opened the way to a selection without incurring the enmity of all
but the one chosen.</p>
<p>But what should be the nature of the contest? Each of the rival
chiefs was probably noted for his skill in some especial
accomplishment, and the difficulty was in naming a trial that would
seem to be just to all. Unable to decide the matter himself, Puna
appealed to the high-priest, and the next day announced that his
<i>palaoa</i>&mdash;a talisman consisting of a whale&rsquo;s tooth,
carved and sanctified&mdash;would be sent by a trusty messenger to the
little island of Kaula; that four days thereafter the rival chiefs
should, each in his own canoe, start at the same time and place from
Kauai, and the one who returned with the <i>palaoa</i>, which the
messenger would be instructed to give to the first of the contesting
chiefs to land and claim it on the rocks of Kaula, should be the
husband of Hooipo, and the others must remain his friends. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>The
size of the canoes was left to the discretion of the several
contestants, but as no more than four assistants would be allowed to
each, very large canoes, of course, would not be used. Any means of
speed might be employed, including oars, paddles and sails.</p>
<p>The contest was admitted to be as fair as any that could be devised,
and the rival chiefs declared themselves satisfied with it, and began
to prepare for the race by securing suitable canoes and skilful and
stalwart assistants. It promised to be an exciting contest, and the
whole of Kapaa was on tiptoe to witness the start.</p>
<p>After a few days of preparation the messenger of Puna was despatched
with the <i>palaoa</i> to Kaula, with instructions to place it in the
hands of the first of the contesting chiefs to claim it on that island.
The messenger had been gone two days, and had probably reached his
destination, as the distance to be travelled was but little more than a
hundred miles, and the rival chiefs had everything in readiness to bend
their sails for Kaula, when Moikeha, as already stated, anchored his
fleet in the evening off Kapaa.</p>
<p>Early next morning, with his double canoe flying the standard of his
rank and otherwise becomingly dressed, Moikeha went ashore, where he
was cordially received by the chiefs of the district, and in due time
escorted to the sovereign mansion and presented to Puna. Without
referring to his family connections, he simply announced that he was a
chief from the distant land of Kahiki, and was traveling through the
Hawaiian group on a tour of observation and pleasure. He wore a
<i>maro</i> fringed with shells, a <i>kihei</i> or mantle of
finely-woven and decorated cloth, and on his head a <i>lei-alii</i> of
brilliant feathers, while from his neck was suspended by a cord of
plaited hair a curious ornament of mother-of-pearl set in ivory. He was
a handsome representative of savage manhood, and his bearing was
dignified, correct and courtly.</p>
<p>During his audience with Puna, Moikeha met Hooipo&mdash;most likely
by accident, but he was so charmed by her bright eyes that he did not
leave the mansion until he found occasion to exchange a few pleasant
words with her. They seemed to be mutually pleased with each other, and
Moikeha accepted the invitation of the chief to consider himself his
guest until the next <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127"
name="pb127">127</a>]</span>day, at the same time allowing him to send
fresh provisions to his people, whose canoes had been drawn up on the
beach.</p>
<p>A brilliant entertainment of feasting, music and dancing in honor of
the distinguished stranger followed in the evening, during which
Moikeha was favored with the companionship of Hooipo, and learned of
the contest about to take place between the rival chiefs of Kauai to
determine to whom she should be given in marriage.</p>
<p>Hilarity and feasting were the order of the next day and evening,
for on the morning following the contesting chiefs were to start for
Kaula under the eye of Puna. Their well-equipped canoes were on the
beach, and their crews, drilled to work sail and oar together, were in
readiness.</p>
<p>Morning came, and with it a large concourse of people to witness the
departure of the chiefs. The canoes and their attending crews were
examined, and many wagers laid on the result of the race. Finally the
contesting chiefs made their appearance, followed shortly after by Puna
and the most of his household, including Hooipo, who was conveyed to
the beach in a <i>manele</i> borne on the shoulders of four stout
attendants. She was attired in an embroidered <i>pau</i>&mdash;a short
skirt of five thicknesses of thin <i>kapa</i> cloth reaching to the
knees&mdash;and a cape or short mantle trimmed with feathers. Her hair
was braided in a single strand at the back; her head and neck were
adorned with <i>leis</i> of flowers and feathers, and her limbs were
ornamented with circlets of shells and tinted seeds.</p>
<p>Everything being in readiness, the contending chiefs, eight in
number, appeared before the <i>alii-nui</i>, and, bowing low, proceeded
in turn to recite their <i>kuauhaus</i>, or genealogies, as they had
been called upon to do, to show in a formal manner that all their
strains were noble. As each concluded he again bowed, giving Hooipo a
smile and look of confidence, and stepped back to await the signal of
departure.</p>
<p>The last of them had given his pedigree, the terms of the contest
had again been announced in form by a herald, and Puna was about to
order the simultaneous launching of the canoes, when Moikeha, whose
presence had not before been observed by the chiefs, suddenly presented
himself before the <i>alii-nui</i>, and, bowing first to him and then
courteously to the chiefs, said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128"
href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Great chief, as this trial seems to be free to all of noble
blood, I accept the terms, and ask permission to present myself as a
contestant for the prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chiefs exchanged glances of surprise, and a pleased expression
lighted up the face of Hooipo, who until that moment had manifested but
little interest in what was transpiring around her.</p>
<p>Puna hesitated a moment, and then graciously replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noble stranger, if your rank is level with the conditions,
and the chiefs now ready for departure urge no objection, my consent
will not be withheld.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hurried consultation among the chiefs showed that some of them
objected; but as the stranger, with no knowledge of the coast and
apparently no canoe or crew in readiness, did not seem to be a
competitor to be feared, it was finally agreed that, should he be able
to establish his rank, which a few of them doubted, he might be
admitted to the contest.</p>
<p>This resolution having been communicated, Moikeha gracefully bowed
his thanks, and then began to recite his genealogy. Curious to learn
the strain of the courtly stranger, the chiefs pressed around him,
eagerly listening to every word. He began with Wakea, away back in the
past, when his ancestors were residents of other lands referred to in
Hawaiian story. Giving the record of thirteen generations, he brought
the connection down to Nanamaoa, the pioneer of the first migratory
influx to the Hawaiian group seven hundred years before. Thence,
generation by generation, naming father, mother and heir, he traced
down a line of sixteen successors to Maweke. Pausing a moment, while a
look of surprise and wonder was exchanged by the listening chiefs,
Moikeha continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maweke the husband,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naiolaukea the wife;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mulielealii the husband,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wehelani the wife;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moikeha the husband,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooipo the wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Applause followed this announcement by the stranger that he was the
son of Mulielealii, the <i>alii-nui</i> of Oahu, and the jesting and
good-natured manner in which he concluded the <i>kuauhau</i> by
predicting his success in the coming contest, and marriage <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>with
Hooipo, made him no enemies among the competing chiefs. Hooipo was now
sure that she could make a choice without the trouble and excitement of
a race to Kaula; but the canoes were ready, and all she could do was to
hope and pray that Moikeha would bring back the <i>palaoa</i>.</p>
<p>But what were Moikeha&rsquo;s preparations for the race? When asked
by Puna, he pointed to a small canoe with an outrigger drawn up on the
beach, and a single long-haired man of strange aspect standing
motionless beside it with a paddle in his hand. Puna shook his head
doubtingly, and Hooipo looked disappointed. Others who noted the
stranger&rsquo;s slim preparations for the race imagined that he was
treating the contest as a jest; but he announced himself in readiness,
and the signal for departure was given.</p>
<p>The chiefs sprang toward the beach, and in a few minutes had
launched their canoes and passed through the heavy surf, when with
strong and steady pulling the race began in earnest for the open sea.
Moikeha alone seemed to be in no haste. He took formal leave of Puna,
and, noting Hooipo&rsquo;s look of impatience, smilingly said to her as
he turned toward the beach: &ldquo;I will bring back the
<i>palaoa</i>!&rdquo; The assurance contented her. The other canoes
were beyond the surf, but she believed him and was happy.</p>
<p>Satisfying himself that the sail was ready for use and everything
required for the voyage aboard, Moikeha and his assistant shoved their
canoe into the water, and with a few vigorous strokes of their paddles
dashed through the surf. The passage was so adroitly made as to attract
the attention of the many who witnessed it from the shore. For a few
minutes the canoe remained almost motionless, except as it was tossed
from wave to wave. Then the sail was spread. This movement was
unaccountable to those on shore, for the little wind stirring was
directly from the west, to which point the canoe was bearing for an
offing to round the southern capes of the island. But if the witnesses
were surprised at the spreading of a sail under such circumstances,
they were little less than astounded when they saw the sail fill with
wind and the canoe suddenly speed out to sea as if driven by a
hurricane.</p>
<p>Moikeha&rsquo;s long-haired companion was Laamaomao, god of the
winds, who had accompanied him from Raiatea. Behind the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>sail
sat the friendly deity, from whose exhaustless <i>ipu</i> of imprisoned
winds a gale was sent forth which carried the canoe to Kaula before
daylight the next morning. Effecting a landing soon after sunrise,
Puna&rsquo;s messenger was found, and at once delivered to Moikeha the
<i>palaoa</i>, which he had been instructed to surrender to the chief
first demanding it. Content in the possession of the talisman, Moikeha
and his companion remained on the island for refreshment until past
midday, and then started on their return to Kauai, favored by the same
winds that had borne them to Kaula, but proceeding with less haste.
Toward night the eight other chiefs landed within a few hours of each
other, and great was their astonishment on learning that the
<i>palaoa</i> had been delivered to a chief claiming it early that
morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have had wings,&rdquo; said one of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was surely helped by the gods,&rdquo; suggested another,
who had been the first to land after Moikeha. &ldquo;But for that the
<i>palaoa</i> would have been mine, as you all know. But who can
struggle with the gods? Let us not incur their anger by
complaint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it was easy for the others to reconcile themselves to
Moikeha&rsquo;s success, good-humor was soon restored, and the next
morning, in company with the messenger, they all re-embarked for Kauai.
On the evening of the same day Moikeha landed at Kapaa, and hastened to
place in the hands of Puna the talisman which made him the husband of
Hooipo. Now assured of the rank of the victor, Puna was gratified at
his success, and Hooipo made no disguise of her joy. Tradition says she
fell in love with the handsome stranger on first beholding him; but be
that as it may, when he returned from Kaula with the <i>palaoa</i> she
was frank enough to confess that his success had made her happy.</p>
<p>In the course of a few days all of the defeated chiefs returned to
Kapaa, and Moikeha invited them to a feast, over which they forgot
their rivalry and renewed the pledges of friendship embraced in the
terms and made a condition of the contest. They sought by many
ingenious ways to draw from Moikeha the secret of his success; but he
failed to enlighten them, and they were compelled to content themselves
with the belief that he had been assisted by some supernatural power,
possibly by <i>Apukohai</i>, the great fish-god of Kauai, who sometimes
seized canoes and bore them onward with almost incredible velocity.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>In due time Hooipo became the wife of Moikeha, who, on the death of
Puna, succeeded him as the <i>alii-nui</i> of Kauai, where he remained
to the end of his life. He was blessed with a number of sons, through
one of whom, it may be mentioned, the sovereignty of the island was
continued in the family after Moikeha was laid under the black
<i>kapa</i>.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Tradition next refers to Moikeha about twenty-five
years after his marriage with Hooipo. The death of Puna had left him
the sovereignty of Kauai, and his principal residence was at Waialua.
He had seven sons, and his court, like that of his predecessor, was
noted for the distinguished chiefs, priests, prophets and poets
connected with it.</p>
<p>As the life of Moikeha was drawing to a close a strong desire
possessed him to see once more his foster-son Laa, whom, on his
departure from Raiatea, he had left with his brother Olopana, whose
presumptive heir and successor the young chief had become. In
preparation for a journey thither he ordered a number of large double
canoes to be repaired and put in order for the open sea, and had some
time before despatched a large party of hunters to the cliffs along the
coast for the feathers of the <i>mamo</i>, from which to fabricate a
royal mantle for the ward of his youth.</p>
<p>As but a single small yellow feather of the kind used in a royal
mantle is found under each wing of the <i>mamo</i>, the task of
securing the many thousands required was by no means a brief or easy
service; but in time the feathers were gathered and the cloak was
completed. As the choicest feathers alone were used, the garment was
one of the most brilliant and elaborate ever made on Kauai, and
represented the labor of a hundred persons for a year.</p>
<p>But when everything was in readiness for his departure for the
south, Moikeha concluded that he was too old and feeble to undertake
the voyage. In this conclusion he was sustained by the auguries of the
prophets and the persuasion of his sons. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>His third son was
Kila. He was distinguished for his capacity and courage, and especially
for his skill as a navigator, and it was finally decided that he should
make the journey to Raiatea as the messenger of Moikeha, and invite Laa
to revisit the Hawaiian group, assuring him of the feeble health of his
foster-father and of his anxiety to embrace him before death separated
them for ever.</p>
<p>Kila was delighted with the mission. For several years intercourse
between the Hawaiian and southern groups had been almost completely
suspended, but from boyhood his dreams had been of visits to the
far-off and misty shores of Kahiki, of which he had heard Moikeha
speak; and now that an opportunity was presented for gratifying his
appetite for adventure in unknown seas, his joy was boundless, and so
vigorously did he push the work of preparation that in a few days the
canoes were equipped and provisioned for the voyage. The provisions
consisted, in long voyages of that period, of dried fish, dried bananas
and plantains, cocoanuts, yams and potatoes, with <i>poi</i> and
<i>paiai</i>, fresh fruits and cooked fowls and pigs, for early
consumption. Large calabashes of fresh water were also provided, but
frequent baths largely diminished the craving for that necessity.</p>
<p>Sacrifices were offered, the auguries were pronounced favorable, and
the fleet of double canoes set sail for the south. Kila was accompanied
by three of his brothers, and, more important still, by the venerable
Kamahualele, the friend and astrologer of Moikeha, who had borne him
company from Raiatea more than a quarter of a century before, and
chanted his inspired visions of the future off the coast of Kau. He
went as Kila&rsquo;s chief navigator and especial counsellor.</p>
<p>The fleet passed through the group and took its final departure from
the most southern point of the island of Hawaii. Wind and weather were
both favorable, and without a mishap of consequence the expedition
arrived in due time at Raiatea, first touching for guidance at some of
the other islands of the southern group.</p>
<p>Kila landed at Opoa through the sacred entrance of Avamoa. His flag
and state were recognized by Olopana, who was still living, and the
sons of Moikeha and their personal attendants were ceremoniously
conducted to the royal mansion, where Kila made known the purpose of
his visit. Olopana was greatly interested in the story of
Moikeha&rsquo;s successful establishment on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>Kauai, but refrained from referring to the
circumstances which led to their separation many years before. He was
also informed of the death of his father, Mulielealii, and the
succession of his brother Kumuhonua to the rank and authority of
<i>alii-nui</i> of Oahu.</p>
<p>With the affectionate greetings of Moikeha, Kila presented to Laa
the brilliant <i>mamo</i>, or royal mantle, of which he was made the
bearer, and expressed the hope that he would comfort the few remaining
days of his foster-father by returning with him on a visit to Kauai.
Olopana strongly objected to the proposed journey, urging his advanced
years and the probability of his early death; but when assured by Laa
of his speedy return he reluctantly consented, and after a round of
hospitable feasts and entertainments, in his own double canoes, and
attended by his priest, astrologer, master of ceremonies, musicians,
and a number of knightly and noble friends, Laa accompanied Kila and
his party back to Hawaii.</p>
<p>The voyage was made in good time, and as the combined fleet, with
canoes of royal yellow and pennons flying, coursed through the group to
Kauai, stopping at several points to exchange courtesies with the
ruling chiefs, it attracted unusual attention; and when Laa landed at
Waialua, on the island of Oahu, to greet his relatives, and the people
learned that the son of Ahukai had returned from the distant land of
Kahiki rich in honors and possessions, they strewed his path with
flowers and welcomed him as if he were a god.</p>
<p>Proceeding to Kauai, after a brief stay at Waialua, Laa was
affectionately received by Moikeha, his foster-father, who had left him
a child in Kahiki, and for a month or more the Kauaian court blazed
nightly with feasts and festivals given in his honor.</p>
<p>Returning to Oahu, Laa took up his residence for a time at Kualoa. A
large mansion was constructed for him, with ample accommodations for
his friends and retainers, and the chiefs of the island esteemed it an
honor to share his friendship and accept his hospitality.</p>
<p>There was no jealousy of Laa, for it was known that he would soon
return to Raiatea, there to permanently remain as the heir and
successor of Olopana. In his veins ran the noblest blood of Oahu. He
was the son of the great-grandson of the great Paumakua in direct and
unchallenged descent, and the adopted <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>heir of the grandson
of Maweke, the proud descendant of the Nanaula dynasty of kings.</p>
<p>It was not deemed well that the line of Paumakua, through so
distinguished a representative as Laa, should be perpetuated solely on
a foreign soil. From a suggestion the matter came to be seriously
discussed by the leading chiefs, and finally Laa was approached on the
subject. Being a young man, the patriotic proposal of the chiefs very
naturally accorded with his tastes, and, without great persuasion, he
expressed a willingness to comply with what seemed to be a general
request.</p>
<p>But the approval of Laa did not quite settle the delicate question,
as the chiefs at once observed on casting around for a suitable wife
for so desirable a husband. The most of them had daughters or sisters
of eligible rank and age. But which one of them should they select?
Whose family should be so honored? They were willing to leave the
choice to Laa, but, sagaciously anticipating the result, he declined to
make the selection.</p>
<p>As usual in momentous cases of doubt, the high-priest was consulted,
and the matter was settled in a manner quite satisfactory to Laa. It
was agreed that he should marry three wives, all on the same day, and
the maidens selected were Hoakanui, daughter of Lonokaehu, of Kualoa;
Waolena, daughter of a chief of Kaalaea; and Mano, daughter of a chief
of Kaneohe. All were noted for their beauty and distinguished
blood.</p>
<p>The three brides were brought to the mansion of Laa, at Kualoa, on
the day fixed for the triple marriage, and the event was celebrated
with splendor and enthusiasm. The <i>hoao</i>, or marriage agreement,
was made public by a herald, as was then the custom among the nobility;
the brides, attired becomingly and decked with garlands, were delivered
in form to the bride-groom, and in the evening a feast was served on
the grounds to more than a thousand guests, with <i>hula</i>,
<i>mele</i>, and other festive accompaniments, including
<i>mele-inoas</i>, or songs of personal application to the new wives
and their husband.</p>
<p>This triple marriage is one of the most thoroughly-established
incidents of remote Hawaiian tradition. After his marriage Laa remained
a year at Kualoa, and then began to prepare for his return to Raiatea.
He looked forward to his departure with mingled feelings of regret and
satisfaction, for his brief married life had been singularly as well as
most bountifully blessed. On <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href=
"#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>the same day he had been presented
with a son by each of his three wives, and an ancient chant thus refers
to the event:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;O Ahukai, O Laa-a, O Laa,</p>
<p class="line">O Laa from Kahiki, the chief;</p>
<p class="line">O Ahukini-a-Laa,</p>
<p class="line">O Kukona-a-Laa,</p>
<p class="line">O Lauli-a-Laa, the father</p>
<p class="line">The triple canoe of Laa-mai-kahiki,</p>
<p class="line">The sacred first-born children of Laa,</p>
<p class="line">Who were born on the same one day.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Moikeha died soon after, and Laa bade farewell to the
Hawaiian Islands and returned to Raiatea just in time to receive the
dying blessing of Olopana. As he had promised, he left his three wives
and their sons in Oahu, where they were well cared for. The names of
the children, as mentioned in the chant quoted, were Ahukini-a-Laa,
Kukona-a-Laa, and Lauli-a-Laa, from whom it was in after-generations
the pride and glory of the governing families of Oahu and Kauai to
trace their lineage. From Ahukini-a-Laa Queen Kapiolani, wife of
Kalakaua, the present sovereign of the islands, is recorded in descent
through a line of Kauaian chiefs and kings.</p>
<p>Kila, after his return from Raiatea, established himself in the
valley of Waipio, on the island of Hawaii, and became prosperous in the
possessions abandoned by his uncle Olopana a generation before. He was
the ancestor of several prominent Hawaiian families, who traced their
descent to him as late as during the reign of Kamehameha I.</p>
<p>With the return of Laa to Raiatea all communication between the
Hawaiian and southern groups seems to have abruptly terminated, and for
a period of about six hundred years, or until the arrival of Captain
Cook in 1778, the Hawaiians learned nothing of the great world beyond
their little archipelago, and knew that lands existed elsewhere only
through the mysterious <i>mooolelos</i> of their priests, and a
folk-lore consisting of broken chains of fables and tales of the past
in which the supernatural had finally become the dominant feature.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the pantheon of ancient Hawaiian worship&mdash;or,
rather, of the worship of the group from the twelfth century to the
nineteenth&mdash;the deity most feared and respected, especially on the
island of Hawaii, was the goddess Pele. She was the queen of fire and
goddess of volcanoes, and her favorite residence was the vast and
ever-seething crater of Kilauea, beneath whose molten flood, in halls
of burning adamant and grottoes of fire, she consumed the offerings of
her worshippers and devised destruction to those who long neglected her
or failed to respect her prerogatives.</p>
<p>Her assistants and companions, as related by tradition, were her
five brothers and eight sisters, all of them clothed with especial
functions, and all but little less merciless and exacting than Pele
herself. The first in authority under Pele was <i>Moho</i>, king of
steam. The others were charged, respectively, with the duties of
creating explosions, thunders and rains of fire, moving and keeping the
clouds in place, breaking canoes, fighting with spears of flame,
hurling red-hot masses of lava, and doing whatever else the goddess
commanded.</p>
<p>As the family claimed tribute of the entire island of Hawaii, to
receive it they frequently visited the active and extinct craters of
other districts, and earthquakes heralded their departure from Kilauea.
The temples of Pele were numerous, particularly in the neighborhood of
old lava-flows, and their priests were always well sustained. The
crater of Kilauea was especially sacred to the goddess, and the earth
around it could not be safely disturbed. An offering was first made of
a part of everything eaten there, and fruits, pigs, fowls, fish, and
sometimes human beings, were thrown into the crater to appease the
wrath of the goddess and avert a threatened overflow.</p>
<p>The Pele family was neither connected with, nor controlled
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>by, the supreme gods of Hawaiian worship, nor
was it a part either of the ancient or later theocracy of the group, as
brought down by the priesthood of <i>Hika-paloa</i>, the godhead and
trinity of original creation. It was an indigenous and independent
development of the twelfth century, until which period the family was
unknown on Hawaii; and the strong hold it secured and for centuries
maintained in the native heart was due partly to a popular faith in,
and worship of, the spirits of departed chiefs and ancestors, and
partly to the continued and ever-visible evidences of the power and
malignity of the volcanic deities. And so, indeed, was it with the many
other deities of Hawaiian adoration. While <i>Kane</i> was deemed the
creator and undoubted superior of them all, they were seldom restrained
in the exercise of their several functions, and individual appeals to
them through their priests were necessary to secure their favor or
placate their wrath.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Type of Scenery&mdash;on the Island of Kauai.</p>
</div>
<p>With this brief reference to the worship and attributes of the
terrible goddess and her family, the story of their mortal lives will
now be told, and a plain relation given of the strange events which led
to their apotheosis. Every tradition refers to them as deities at the
time of their arrival at Hawaii and occupation of Kilauea, and all
abound in marvellous tales of their exploits, the most wonderful being
connected with the Oahuan warrior Kamapuaa, one of the lovers of Pele,
who was transformed by the bards into a supernatural monster&mdash;a
being half-man and half-hog&mdash;with powers almost equal to those of
Pele herself. A careful analysis, however, of the various
<i>mooolelos</i> of Pele and her family renders it plain that they came
to the group as simple human beings, and as human beings lived and
died, as did also Kamapuaa, and that superstition subsequently elevated
their mortal deeds to the realms of supernatural achievement.</p>
<p>The Pele family came to Hawaii during the reign of Kamiole, the
usurper, from one of the southern islands&mdash;probably Samoa&mdash;in
about the year <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1175. It was of chiefly
blood, and also of priestly lineage, and, to escape the penalties of
defeat, had, at the close of a long and disastrous war, fled northward
and found a home on Hawaii. The head of the family had fallen in
battle, and Moho, the eldest of the sons, assumed the direction of what
remained of the once powerful household.</p>
<p>The fugitives first landed at Honuapo, in the district of Kau,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>but, finding no lands there available, coasted
along to the southern shores of Puna, and finally located in the
valleys back of Keauhou, among the foothills of Mauna Loa, including
the crater of Kilauea. A few miles to the westward an overflow had
reached the sea the year before, and as the volcano was still active,
and earthquakes were of frequent occurrence in the neighborhood, the
valleys had been deserted, and the new-comers who boldly settled there
were soon spoken of as being under the especial protection of the gods,
since they seemed to fear neither earthquakes nor threatened
inundations of fire. Under the circumstances almost everything they did
was credited to supernatural agencies, and it was not long before Pele,
Moho and Kamakaua&mdash;the three most influential members of the
little community&mdash;were regarded as <i>kahunas</i> of unusual
sanctity and power.</p>
<p>The Pele family proper consisted, at that time, of Pele, her two
brothers, Moho and Kamakaua, and a younger sister named Ulolu, who was
after her apotheosis known as <i>Hiiaka-ika-pali-opele</i>. With them,
however, were a number of relatives&mdash;principally females, whose
protectors had perished in the struggle preceding their departure from
Samoa&mdash;and about thirty attendants. The brothers were large,
stalwart men, who had distinguished themselves in arms in their native
land, and their attendants were warriors of tried courage and capacity.
From these companions and assistants were created the three additional
brothers and seven sisters of Pele mentioned in the <i>meles</i> of the
bards. One of the former&mdash;<i>Kanehekili</i>&mdash;is said to have
been a hunchback, as was also Kamakaua, but the fighting qualities of
neither seem to have been impaired by the deformity.</p>
<p>Pele was as courageous as she was personally attractive. She had
taken an active part in the wars of her father, and with her own hand
had slain a chief who attempted to abduct her. Her brothers were
devoted to her, and her bright eyes and queenly presence commanded the
respect and homage of all who approached her.</p>
<p>And now, cultivating their lands in the valleys back of Keauhou, and
living contentedly and without fear of molestation, we will leave the
little colony for a time and refer to another important character in
the story we are telling&mdash;Kamapuaa, the traditional monster of
Oahu, whose deeds so aggrandize the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>folk-lore of that
island. In some <i>meles</i> he is depicted as a hog with a human head,
and in others as a being with a human form and head of a hog; but in
all he is described as a monster of prodigious bulk and malicious and
predatory propensities.</p>

<h3 class="main">II.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Glancing back a half-century or more before the
landing of the Pele family in Puna, we note the arrival in the group of
a number of independent parties of immigrants or adventurers from the
southern islands. Among them were the chiefs Kalana and Huma. They came
with considerable of a following, including the beautiful Kamaunui and
a few of her relatives. The party landed on the island of Maui, and,
after some wandering and change of locations, finally settled in
Waihee, a spot noted for its beauty and natural advantages. Huma loved
the fair Kamaunui. He had whispered soft words to her on their long
journey from Kahiki, and fed her with the choicest food to be found
among the stores of his great double canoe; but she loved Kalana
better, and, when she became his wife, Huma abruptly left Waihee,
returning, it is supposed, to his native land.</p>
<p>The only child of this marriage was Hina, who on reaching womanhood
became the wife of Olopana, a chief of the island of Oahu. Although of
the same name, he was in nowise related to the Olopana who was the
brother of Moikeha and grandson of Maweke. This chief had arrived from
the south a few years before his marriage with Hina, and, with his
younger brother, Kahikiula, settled in Koolau, or on the Koolau side of
the island of Oahu, where he had acquired very considerable
possessions. By what chance he met Hina, or through what influence he
won her, tradition does not mention, but as his wife she went with him
to Oahu, and there remained.</p>
<p>Hina was fair, and Kahikiula, unlike his brother, was young and
handsome. They were happy in the society of each other, and were
therefore much together. She went with him to the hills for wild fruits
and berries, and he followed her to the sea-shore to gather shells and
limpets. The jealousy of Olopana was at last aroused, and when Hina
presented him with a son he charged Kahikiula with its paternity and
refused to accept the child as his own. This estranged the brothers and
made the lot of Hina miserable. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143"
href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p>From its birth Olopana disliked the child, and in his resentment
named it Kamapuaa, signifying a hog-child, or child of a hog. As the
infant showed no marked physical characteristics of that animal, it is
probable that Olopana fastened upon it the graceless appellation in a
spirit of retaliation. But, whatever may have prompted its bestowal,
the child certainly bore the name through life, thus giving to the
bards who chanted the story of his acts the cue and pretext for shaping
him into the monster depicted by tradition.</p>
<p>Having no love for Kamapuaa, Olopana took little interest in his
growth from year to year to the mighty manhood which he finally
attained, and which excited the admiration of all others. The more
Kamapuaa was praised the greater dislike did Olopana feel for him, and
at length the presence of the young giant became so obnoxious to him
that he ordered him, under penalty of death, to leave the district.</p>
<p>Failing to understand the cause of this unnatural hatred, the anger
of Kamapuaa was at last aroused, and he strode away from the home of
his youth with his heart filled with bitterness and vows of vengeance.
As he left, Kahikiula presented him with a long and finely-finished
spear tipped with bone, and his mother threw over his broad shoulders
the feather cape of a chief, and hung around his neck a <i>palaoa</i>,
or talisman carved from the tooth of some great animal of the sea.</p>
<p>Kamapuaa knew of a large cavern in the hills some miles distant from
Koolau, the name by which will be designated the place of his birth,
and thither he repaired and took up his residence. He led a wild,
predatory life, and was soon joined by others as reckless as himself,
until the party numbered fifty or sixty in all. Made bolder by this
following, Kamapuaa began to harass the estates of Olopana. He stole
his pigs, fowls and fruits, and whatever else his little band required,
and delighted in breaking his nets, cutting adrift his canoes and
robbing his fish-ponds. In a spirit of youthful bravado he had his
body, from his loins upward, tattooed in black, shaved his head and
beard to the resemblance of bristles, and hung from his shoulders a
short mantle of tanned hog-skin, the hair being left to be worn on the
outer side. In this guise his name did not seem to be altogether
inappropriate, and he was pleased at the terror his appearance
inspired. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p>Becoming still bolder, Kamapuaa resolved to inaugurate a more
vigorous warfare upon Olopana, and began to cut down his cocoanut-trees
and destroy his growing crops. This brought the matter to a crisis, as
such acts were always regarded as a declaration of war. The
depredations of Kamapuaa were invariably committed at night, and it was
some time before the real aggressors were discovered. Koolau was filled
with stories of the marauding exploits of a lawless band, led by a
monster half-man and half-hog, and the <i>kahunas</i> were called upon
to ascertain the character of the spoilers, and, if found to be
supernatural, placate them with sacrifices.</p>
<p>While the <i>kilos</i> were plying their arts the mystery was
suddenly solved in a more practical manner. Detected one night in
destroying the walls of one of Olopana&rsquo;s fish-ponds, Kamapuaa and
a number of his party were secretly followed to their hiding-place in
the hills. This information was brought to Olopana, and he promptly
equipped a small force of warriors to follow and capture or destroy the
plundering band, which, he was enraged beyond all measure in learning,
was under the leadership of his outcast son or nephew, Kamapuaa.</p>
<p>But the task of capturing or destroying Kamapuaa and his band was by
no means an easy one. Of the party first sent to attack them in their
mountain stronghold all were killed with the exception of a single
warrior, and he was allowed to return to tell the tale of the slaughter
and take to Olopana the defiance of Kamapuaa.</p>
<p>This satisfied the chief that Kamapuaa&rsquo;s purpose was rebellion
as well as pillage, and a force of six hundred warriors was organized
and sent against the outlaws. This forced Kamapuaa to change his
tactics, and, leaving their retreat, in which they might have been
surrounded and brought to submission by famine, the rebels retired
farther back into the mountains, where they for months defied the whole
force of Olopana. Frequent skirmishes occurred and many lives were
lost, but every attempt to surround and capture the desperate band was
frustrated by the dash and sagacity of their leader.</p>
<p>Once, when closely pursued and pressed against the verge of a narrow
gorge, the rebels crossed the chasm and escaped to the other side by
some means unknown to their pursuers, and the story was told and
believed that Kamapuaa, taking the form <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>of a gigantic hog,
had spanned the gorge and given his followers speedy passage over his
back to the other side, when he leaped across at a single bound and
escaped with them. The spot marking this marvellous achievement is
still pointed out at Hauula, and the tracks of the monster in the solid
rock are shown.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say just how long this desultory fighting
continued, but in the end the rebels were surrounded and nearly
destroyed, and Kamapuaa was captured unhurt and delivered over to
Olopana, to the great joy and relief of the people of Koolau. Olopana
had erected a <i>heiau</i> at Kaneohe, where Lonoaohi officiated as
high-priest, and thither he resolved to take his rebellious son or
nephew, and offer him as a sacrifice to the gods. Hina pleaded for the
life of Kamapuaa, but Olopana could not be moved. Satisfied that he
would listen to no appeals for mercy, she determined to save her son,
even at the sacrifice of her husband, and to that end secured the
assistance of the high-priest, through whose treachery to Olopana the
life of Kamapuaa was saved.</p>
<p>On the day fixed for the sacrifice Kamapuaa, carefully bound and
strongly guarded, was taken to the <i>heiau</i>, followed by Olopana,
who was anxious to witness the ghastly ceremonies, and with his own
eyes see that his troublesome enemy was duly slain and his body laid
upon the altar. In offering human sacrifices the victim was taken
without the walls of the <i>heiau</i> and slain with clubs by the
assistants of the high-priest. The body was then brought in and placed
upon the altar in front of the entrance to the inner court, or
sanctuary, when the left eye was removed by the officiating priest, and
handed, if he was present, to the chief who had ordered the sacrifice.
This being done, the offering was then ceremoniously made, and the body
was left upon the altar for the elements to deal with.</p>
<p>Standing, with three or four attendants, at the door of his
<i>tabued</i> retreat, within forty or fifty paces of the altar,
Olopana saw his victim preliminarily led to the place of sacrifice, and
a few minutes after motioned for the ceremonies to begin. Kamapuaa was
taken without the walls of the temple to be slain. He was in charge of
three assistant priests, one of them leading him by a stout cord around
his neck, another keeping closely behind him, and the third walking
silently at his side with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146"
href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>club of execution in his
hand. Passing beyond the outer wall, the party entered a small walled
enclosure adjoining, and the executioner raised his club and brought it
down upon the head of his victim. Kamapuaa smiled, but did not move.
Twice, thrice with mighty sweep the club descended upon the head of
Kamapuaa, but scarcely bent the bristly hairs upon his crown.</p>
<p>With a semblance of wonder the executioner, whose tender blows would
have scarcely maimed a mouse, dropped his club and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three times have I tried and failed to slay him! The gods
refuse the sacrifice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so, it is so, it is so!&rdquo; chimed his companions.
&ldquo;The gods indeed refuse the sacrifice! We have seen
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore, instead of slaying Kamapuaa, the assistants, as they had
been secretly instructed to do by the high-priest, removed the cords
from his limbs, smeared his hair, face and body with the fresh blood of
a fowl, and on their shoulders bore him back and placed him upon the
altar as if dead.</p>
<p>The high-priest approached the apparently lifeless body, and bent
for a moment over the face, as if to remove the left eye; then placing
on a wooden tray the eye of a large hog, which had been procured for
that purpose, he sent an assistant with it to Olopana, at the same time
retiring within the inner court, and leaving by the side of Kamapuaa,
and near his right hand, as if by accident, the sharp ivory
<i>pahoa</i>, or dagger, with which he had, to all appearance, been
operating.</p>
<p>Giving but a single glance at the eye presented to him by the
assistant of the high-priest, Olopana passed it to an attendant without
the customary semblance of eating it, and approached the altar alone.
Kamapuaa did not breathe. His face was streaked with blood, his eyelids
were closed, and not a single muscle moved to indicate life.</p>
<p>Olopana looked at the hated face for a moment, and then turned to
leave the <i>heiau</i>, not caring to witness the ceremonies of the
formal offering. As he did so Kamapuaa clutched the dagger beside his
hand, and, springing from the altar, drove the blade into the back of
Olopana. Again and again he applied the weapon until the chief, with a
groan of anguish, fell dead at the feet of his slayer.</p>
<p>Horrified at what they beheld, the attendants of Olopana
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>sprang toward their fallen chief. But their
movements, whatever their import, did not disturb Kamapuaa. He had been
accustomed to meeting and accepting odds in battle, and when he had
secured possession of the <i>ihe</i> and huge axe of stone conveniently
placed for his use behind the altar, he boldly approached and invited
an encounter.</p>
<p>But the challenge was not accepted. The attendants of the chief did
not ordinarily lack courage, but they were unnerved at the sight of a
victim, slain, mutilated and laid upon the altar by the priest, coming
to life and springing to his feet full-armed before his enemies.</p>
<p>Appearing upon the scene, the high-priest expressed great surprise
and horror at what had occurred, and his assistants wildly clamored at
the sacrilege; but no hand was laid upon Kamapuaa, and the friends of
Olopana finally left the <i>heiau</i>, taking his body with them.</p>
<p>This tragedy in the <i>heiau</i> of Kawaewae created a profound
excitement in the district. Had Kamapuaa been at all popular with the
masses the death of Olopana at his hands would have occasioned but
little indignation; but as many beside the dead chief had suffered
through his plundering visitations, and hundreds of lives had been
sacrificed in his pursuit and final capture, the people rose almost in
a body to hunt him down and destroy him.</p>
<p>Hina attempted to save her son from the wrath of his enemies, but
her influence was insufficient to protect him, and he again sought
refuge in the mountains; but his following was small, and he finally
crossed the island, and, with a party of forty or fifty reckless and
adventurous spirits, set sail for the windward islands in a fleet of
eight or ten canoes which he in some manner obtained from the people of
Ewa.</p>
</div>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">III.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">More than one tradition avers that Kamapuaa traveled
to foreign lands after leaving Oahu, even to the lands where the sky
and sea were supposed to meet; but he made no such journey at that
time. He spent some months in sight-seeing among the islands southeast
of Oahu, and pretty nearly circumnavigated them all. Sometimes, for the
lack of better occupation, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href=
"#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>he and his companions engaged in
the petty wars of the districts visited by them; but they generally led
a roving, careless life, maintaining peaceful relations with all, and
plundering only when every other means of securing supplies failed.</p>
<p>And thus they journeyed from island to island until they reached
Hawaii. Kamiole, the usurper, had but just been defeated and slain by
Kalapana, the son of Kanipahu, the hunchback, and Kohala, where
Kamapuaa first landed, was still suffering from the effects of the war.
He therefore proceeded southward along the coast, touching at several
points in Kona; then rounding the southern cape of the island, he
sailed along the shores of Kau to Honuapo, where he landed and spent
several weeks.</p>
<p>It was while he was there that Kamapuaa first learned of the Pele
family in the adjoining district of Puna, and became acquainted with
the many stories of enchantment and sorcery connected with the little
colony. Pele was described to him as a woman of unusual personal
beauty, and the lands occupied by the family and its retainers were
said to be secure against lava inundations from Kilauea through the
especial favor and protection of the gods.</p>
<p>These strange stories interested Kamapuaa, and he resolved to
satisfy himself of their truth by visiting the mysterious colony. He
accordingly set sail with his companions for Puna, and, landing at
Keauhou, took up his abode near the sea-shore, not far from the lands
occupied by Pele and her relatives.</p>
<p>As the colonists seemed to pay but little attention to the
new-comers, at the expiration of three or four days Kamapuaa concluded
to open a way to an acquaintance with them by visiting their settlement
in person, and with a few of his companions appeared one morning before
the comfortable <i>hale</i> of Pele and her family.</p>
<p>Moho received the strangers courteously, inquired the purpose of
their visit to Keauhou and from what part of the country they came, and
hospitably invited them to a breakfast of meat, potatoes, <i>poi</i>
and fruits. The invitation was not declined, and during the repast Moho
learned from Kamapuaa that he was the chief of the party, and that the
visit of himself and companions to Puna had no especial object beyond
that of observation and pleasure. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149"
href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span></p>
<p>The tattooed body and bristly hair and beard of Kamapuaa imparted to
his otherwise handsome person a strangely ferocious and forbidding
appearance, and at the mention of his name and place of nativity Moho
at once recognized in him, from report, the monster of Oahu, who had
ravaged the estates of Olopana and finally assassinated that chief in
the <i>heiau</i> of Kawaewae. His presence, therefore, in that part of
Puna, was considerably less welcome than the words of Moho implied; but
no act of the latter indicated a suspicion that the ulterior purposes
of his visitors were possibly otherwise than peaceful, and when they
took their departure for the beach it was with mutual assurances of
friendship.</p>
<p>But Kamapuaa did not take his leave that morning until he saw Pele.
He found a pretext for prolonging his visit until she finally appeared,
and when Moho made them known to each other Kamapuaa comported himself
with a grace and gallantry never before observed in him by his
companions. He admitted to himself that the reports of Pele&rsquo;s
beauty had not been exaggerated, and wondered how it happened that she
had remained for years unmarried.</p>
<p>The thought then came to Kamapuaa&mdash;perhaps not for the first
time&mdash;that he would marry Pele himself and settle permanently in
Puna. The idea of marriage had seldom occurred to him, but after he saw
Pele he could think of little else. He greatly admired her appearance,
and could see no reason why she should not be equally well pleased with
his. No mirror, save the uncertain reflection of the waters, had ever
shown him his hideously-tattooed face and bristly hair and beard, and
the hog-skin still worn over his stained shoulders was regarded by him
as a manly and warlike covering, well calculated to impress with favor
a woman of Pele&rsquo;s courage and accomplishments.</p>
<p>But Kamapuaa did not urge his suit at once. He visited Moho almost
every day for half a month or more, and endeavored to render himself
agreeable to Pele by sending her baskets of choice wild fruits, fish
from the sea which women were allowed to eat, and strings of beautiful
and curious shells gathered from the shores and caverns of the coast.
He saw her occasionally, and observed that she avoided him; but he
attributed her seeming repugnance to him to a coyishness common to her
sex, and drew from it no augury unfavorable to his suit. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p>The companions of Kamapuaa soon discovered the attraction that was
keeping him so long in the neighborhood of Keauhou, where food was
becoming the reverse of abundant, and urged him to return to Honuapo;
but he silenced their clamors with promises of good lands and lives of
ease in the valleys back of them, and they hopefully struggled on with
their unsatisfactory fare.</p>
<p>Kamapuaa finally made a proposal of marriage to Pele; but she
refused to entertain it, and was promptly and heartily sustained by her
brothers. But a simple refusal did not satisfy Kamapuaa. He urged that
his blood was noble, and that the proposed union was in every way
fitting and proper, and would prove mutually beneficial. Enraged at his
presumption and persistency, Pele boldly expressed her contempt for him
and aversion to his presence. In return Kamapuaa threatened to seize
her by force and desolate the colony. Tradition asserts that she
thereupon defied his power, and denounced him to his face as &ldquo;a
hog and the son of a hog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, whatever may have been the precise language used on the
occasion by Pele, it was sufficiently definite and insulting not only
to destroy the last hope of Kamapuaa, but to arouse in his heart the
bitterest feelings of revenge, and he retired in wrath to the beach to
plan and speedily execute a terrible scheme of retaliation.</p>
<p>Without referring to his final interview with Pele and her brothers,
Kamapuaa informed his companions that he was at last ready to
move&mdash;not to Honuapo, however, but to the cultivated valleys
immediately back of them, occupied by a family of foreign interlopers
and their adherents, who recognized the authority neither of Kalapana
nor the governing chief of Puna, and might therefore be dispossessed
without incurring the reproach or hostility of any power competent to
punish. The project pleased them, but they doubted their ability to
drive from their lands so large a number, the most of whom were
doubtless skilled in the use of arms.</p>
<p>But Kamapuaa promised to make the way clear to an easy victory. He
said he had carefully noted the number of the settlers, and observed
the places where the most of them lodged. His plan was to suddenly fall
upon them in the night and massacre all the male adherents of the
family. This done, they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href=
"#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>would be masters of the situation,
and able to treat on their own terms with the few who remained. It was
proposed to include the governing family in the slaughter, but Kamapuaa
opposed the suggestion, declaring that one of the brothers of Pele was
a priest of great sanctity, whose death by violence would kindle the
wrath of the gods; and his counsel prevailed.</p>
<p>Several days elapsed without any movement being made. Kamapuaa was
waiting, not only for a relaxation of the vigilance which his
incautious threats may have inspired, but for the dark of the waning
moon. Finally the blow was struck. Under the favoring cover of darkness
Kamapuaa and his companions left the beach and secreted themselves near
the scattered huts of the settlers, and at a signal, some time past
midnight, rose and massacred every man within reach of their weapons.
But few escaped. The screams of the women, who had been spared, rang
through the valleys as they fled toward the mansion of Pele and her
brothers for protection, and the band of murderers returned satisfied
to the beach.</p>
<p>It was the purpose of Kamapuaa to surround the home of the surviving
family the next day, and capture Pele by force, as he had threatened,
or otherwise bring her and her haughty relatives to terms. But, after
what had occurred, Moho readily understood the plans of the assassins,
and early next morning abandoned the family cluster of houses, which
could not be successfully defended, and sought refuge in a cavern in
the hills, about three miles up the valley, accompanied by the entire
family and the few others who had escaped the massacre of the night
before. There was water in the cavern, and as the fugitives took with
them a considerable quantity of provisions, and the opening to the
retreat was small and easily defended, they hoped to be able, even if
discovered and besieged, to protect themselves until the arrival of
relief or the abandonment of the siege as hopeless by their
enemies.</p>
<p>The cavern was of volcanic formation and had never been fully
explored. It embraced a number of large connecting chambers, with
ragged avenues leading back into and up the hill. The only light came
through the front entrance, into which, from the inside, were hastily
rolled heavy boulders of lava, found here and there detached, leaving
openings through which spears and javelins could be thrust. A tiny
rivulet of water trickled in somewhere <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>from the darkness,
and, after filling a shallow basin in the floor of one of the chambers,
ran out through the opening. As air came in from the back of the
cavern, it must have been connected with the surface through some one
or more of the dark avenues referred to; but not a glimmer of light, so
far as the occupants had been able to penetrate the depths, indicated
the possibility of an escape in that direction should the cavern be
rendered untenable by assault. The party numbered, in all, seven men
and eighteen women and children, and they had taken to their retreat a
goodly supply of arms and provisions enough to sustain them for some
weeks. Thus prepared they gloomily awaited their fate.</p>
<p>But they had fled to the hills not a moment too soon, for early in
the day Kamapuaa and his companions appeared and surrounded the
deserted habitations of the family. Discovering that his victims had
escaped, Kamapuaa promptly divided his followers into small parties,
and despatched them to the hills in search of the fugitives or of
traces of their flight. He also joined in the search, but went
unattended.</p>
<p>In the course of the day all returned to the deserted huts, where
they had taken up their quarters, and reported that no traces of the
missing colonists had been discovered, and the general opinion was that
they had escaped across the mountains. Kamapuaa waited until all the
rest had told the stories of their fruitless wanderings, when he
announced that he had found what they had lacked the sagacity to
discover. He informed them that the fugitives were secreted in a cavern
some distance up one of the valleys, where they could be surrounded and
captured without difficulty; but he did not mention that he had made
the discovery by shrewdly following a dog into the hills, and watching
the animal until it stopped in front of the entrance to the cavern. He
was willing that his companions should believe that his success was due
to some inspiration or prescience of his own.</p>
<p>A guard was immediately detailed to watch the cavern and see that no
one escaped, and the next day the place was surrounded and formally
besieged. Following these preparations, visible to Moho and his handful
of warriors, Kamapuaa approached the entrance sufficiently near to be
heard within, and demanded the surrender of the party, promising that
the lives of all would be spared. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153"
href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span></p>
<p>The demand was refused with words of insult and defiance, and
Kamapuaa ordered an assault upon the entrance. Several attempts were
made to force the protecting rocks from the opening, but their
interstices bristled with spear-points, and, after a number of the
assailants had been wounded, that plan of attack was abandoned as
impracticable.</p>
<p>A large quantity of dry wood, leaves and grass was then heaped in
front of the entrance and fired, in the hope of suffocating the inmates
with the heat and smoke of the conflagration; but the draught of air
through the cavern kept the smoke from entering, and, although the heat
for a time became oppressive immediately around the opening, the
connecting chambers were but slightly affected by it. The fire was
allowed to die out, and Kamapuaa, on too closely approaching the
entrance to note its effects, was made keenly aware of the failure of
the project by receiving a sharp spear-thrust in the arm.</p>
<p>As fire and assault had proved unavailing, and a long siege did not
accord with his purposes, Kamapuaa next endeavored to effect a breach
through the top of the cavern in the rear of the entrance. As this
necessitated the removal of an overlying mass of ten or fifteen feet of
soil and rocks, the undertaking involved a very considerable amount of
hard labor. But the plan met with general favor, and, with <i>oos</i>
and other implements obtained from the valleys below, the besiegers
entered upon the task of excavating through into the cavern.</p>
<p>For several days the work progressed almost uninterruptedly, and a
large pit had been lowered to a depth of eight or ten feet, when the
earth began to tremble violently, and a few minutes after the air was
filled with sulphurous smoke and ashes. But this was not the most
appalling sight beheld by Kamapuaa and his companions. Looking up the
valley, which at that point was little more than a narrow gorge, they
saw a flood of lava, full a hundred feet in width, bursting from the
hillside and pouring down the ravine, its high-advancing crest aflame
with burning timber, and sweeping before it a thundering avalanche of
half-molten boulders.</p>
<p>With exclamations of dismay they started in full flight down the
valley, closely followed by the devouring flood. On, on they sped, past
the deserted huts of their victims, past the sandy foothills, past the
cocoa-trees that fringed the beach. Turning at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>the
water&rsquo;s edge, they beheld the awful stream spreading its mantle
of death over the broadening valley, and speeding to the sea in broken
volumes. Leaping into their canoes, they plunged through the surf and
paddled out to sea. Setting sail for Honuapo, Kamapuaa saw, as they
left the coast, that the upper part of the valley from which they had
fled was filled with lava, and knew that the cavern in which Pele and
her companions had sought refuge from his wrath had been deeply buried
by the flood.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Bird&rsquo;s-eye View of the Crater of
Kilauea.</p>
</div>
<p>When the news of the eruption reached Honuapo, the people, who had
heard so many strange stories of Pele and her family, did not believe
that they had perished. On the contrary, they declared that the
eruption had been invoked by Pele to drive Kamapuaa from the district,
and that if she had permitted her lands to be destroyed it was with the
view of taking up her residence in the crater of Kilauea. This opinion
soon crystalized into a belief which spread throughout the island of
Hawaii, and another generation saw temples erected to Pele, the goddess
of fire, and priests sanctified to her service. All but three of her
brothers and sisters were the creations of her early priests, and their
attributes gradually grew and took form as they floated down the stream
of tradition.</p>
<p>Many adventures are related of Kamapuaa after his flight from
Keauhou, but the most or all of them are the dreams of the poets of
after-generations; and further reference here to this most striking of
the early heroes of the group may be properly concluded with the remark
that, shortly after his experiences with the Pele family, he immigrated
with a considerable following to one of the southern islands, where he
married, distinguished himself in arms, and finally died without
revisiting the Hawaiian archipelago. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With the reign of Hua, an ancient king of Hana, or
eastern Maui, is connected a legendary recital of one of the most
terrible visitations of the wrath of the gods anywhere brought down by
Hawaiian tradition. It is more than probable that the extent of the
calamities following Hua&rsquo;s defiant and barbarous treatment of his
high-priest and prophet was greatly colored and exaggerated in turn by
the pious historians who received and passed the <i>moooelo</i> down
the centuries; but the details of the story have been preserved with
harrowing conciseness, and for more than six hundred years were recited
as a solemn warning against wanton trespass upon the prerogatives of
the priesthood or disregard of the power and sanctity of the gods.</p>
<p>In some of the genealogies Hua is represented as having been the
great-grandfather of Paumakua, of Maui. This record, if accepted, would
remove him altogether from the Hawaiian group, since Paumakua himself
was undoubtedly an immigrant from Tahiti or some other of the southern
islands. As he was contemporaneous with the distinguished priest and
prophet Naula, who is said to have accompanied Laa-mai-kahiki from
Raiatea, he must have appeared two or three generations later than
Paumakua, and probably belonged to a collateral branch of the great Hua
family from which Paumakua drew his strain.</p>
<p>It may therefore be assumed that as early as <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 1170 Hua was the <i>alii-nui</i>, or virtual
sovereign, of eastern Maui. He is referred to as the king of Maui, but
it is hardly probable that his sway extended over the western division
of the island, as it was not until the reign of Piilani, nearly three
centuries later, that the people of Maui became finally united under
one government. Previous to that time, except at intervals of temporary
conquest or occupation, eastern and western Maui were ruled by distinct
and frequently hostile lines of kings. Hence the sovereignty of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>Hua could scarcely have reached beyond the
districts of Koolau, Hana, Kipahulu and Kaupo, while the remainder of
the island must have recognized the authority either of Palena, the
grandson of Paumakua, or of Hanalaa, the distinguished son and
successor of Palena, since the later <i>mois</i> of Maui traced their
genealogies uninterruptedly through this branch of the Paumakua
family.</p>
<p>But, from whatever source Hua may have derived his rank and
authority, he was a reckless, independent and warlike chief. Having
access to the largest and finest timber in the group, his war-canoes
were abundant and formidable, and when not engaged in harassing his
neighboring frontiers he was employed in plundering expeditions to the
coasts of Hawaii and Molokai. Tradition makes him the aggressor in the
earliest remembered war between Maui and Hawaii. Although the name of
the war (<i>Kanuioohio</i>) has been preserved, it probably did not
reach beyond the limit of a powerful marauding excursion to the coast
of Hilo, Hawaii, resulting in the defeat of the chiefs of that district
by Hua, but in nothing more than a temporary seizure and occupation of
their lands; for at that time Kanipahu was the <i>moi</i> of Hawaii,
and would scarcely have permitted a permanent hostile lodgment in Hilo,
whose chiefs acknowledged his suzerainty and were therefore entitled to
his protection.</p>
<p>The high-priest of Hua was Luahoomoe. He claimed to be an
<i>iku-pau</i>&mdash;that is, a direct descendant from
<i>Kane</i>&mdash;and as such was strict in claiming respect for his
person and sacred prerogatives. He did not approve of many of
Hua&rsquo;s marauding acts, advising him instead to lead his people in
happier and more peaceful pursuits, and not provoke either the
retaliation of his enemies or the anger of the gods. This opposition to
his aggressive methods exasperated Hua, and a feeling of suspicion and
ill-will gradually grew up between him and the priesthood. He began to
attribute his occasional failures in arms to deliberately-neglected
prayers and sacrifices by Luahoomoe, and on one occasion, after having
returned from an unsuccessful expedition to Molokai, he placed his
<i>tabu</i> on a spring of water set apart for the use of the
<i>heiau</i>, and on another wantonly speared a <i>puaa-hiwa</i>, or
black <i>tabued</i> hog, sacred to sacrifice. When expostulated with
for thus inviting the wrath of the gods, he threatened the high-priest
with similar treatment. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href=
"#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span></p>
<p>Hua resided principally at Hana, where he constructed one of the
largest royal mansions in the group, and all the leisure spared from
his warlike pastimes was given to revelry. He had a hundred <i>hula</i>
dancers, exclusive of musicians and drummers, and his monthly feasts
were prolonged into days and nights of debauchery and unbridled
license. Drunk with <i>awa</i>, an intoxicating drink made from a plant
of that name, he kept the whole of Hana in an uproar during his
frequent seasons of pleasure, and the attractive wives and daughters of
his subjects were not unfrequently seized and given to his favorite
companions.</p>
<p>The annual festival of <i>Lono</i> was approaching&mdash;an event
marking the winter solstice, and which was always celebrated
impressively on every island of the group. It was an occasion not only
for manifesting respect for the nearest and most popular deity of the
godhead, but for celebrating, as well, the ending of the old year and
the beginning of the new. The ancient Hawaiians divided the year into
twelve months of thirty days each. Each month and day of the month was
named. They had two modes of measuring time&mdash;the lunar and
sidereal. The lunar month began on the first day that the new moon
appeared in the west, and regulated their monthly feasts and
<i>tabu</i> days. Their sidereal month of thirty days marked one of the
twelve divisions of the year; but as their two seasons of the
year&mdash;the <i>Hooilo</i> (rainy) and <i>Kau</i> (dry)&mdash;were
measured by the Pleiades, and their twelve months of thirty days each
did not complete the sidereal year, they intercalated five days at the
end of the year measured by months, in order to square that method of
reckoning with the movements of the stars. This annual intercalation
was made about the 20th of their month of <i>Welehu</i> (December), at
the expiration of which the first day of the first month
(<i>Makalii</i>) of the new year commenced. This was their
<i>Makahiki</i>, or new-year day. The five intercalated days were a
season of <i>tabu</i>, and dedicated to a grand yearly festival to
<i>Lono</i>.</p>
<p>In preparation for this festival Hua had called for unusually large
contributions from the people, and, in anticipation of another hostile
expedition to Hawaii, had ordered quotas of warriors, canoes and
provisions from his subject chiefs, to be reported at Hana immediately
after the beginning of the new year. These exactions caused very
general dissatisfaction, and the priesthood assisted in promoting
rather than allaying the popular <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160"
href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>discontent. All this was
reported to Hua, and he resolved to liberate himself at once and for
the future from what he conceived to be an officious and unwarranted
intermeddling of the priesthood with the affairs of state, by deposing
or taking the life of Luahoomoe. In this desperate resolution he was
sustained by Luuana, a priest who had charge of the <i>heiau</i> or
chapel of the royal mansion, and who expected to succeed Luahoomoe as
high-priest.</p>
<p>Hua sought in every way for a pretext for deposing or slaying
Luahoomoe; but the priest was old in years, exemplary in his conduct,
and moved among the people without reproach. Finally, at the
instigation of Luuana, who assumed that the advice was a divine
inspiration, Hua created a bungling and absurd pretence for an assault
upon Luahoomoe. The dishonesty of the scheme was exposed, but it
resulted, nevertheless, in the death of the unoffending priest.</p>
<p>As tradition tells the story, Hua found occasion in a public manner
to order some <i>uwau</i>, or <i>uau</i>, to be brought to him from the
mountains. The <i>uau</i> is a water bird, and seldom found in the
uplands. As neither its flesh for eating nor its feathers for
decorating could have reasonably been required, the object of
despatching snarers in quest of it must have been a subject of comment;
but kings then, as later, did not always deign to give reasons for
their acts, and preparations were at once made by the household
servants and retainers of the king to proceed upon the hunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful that the birds come from the mountains,&rdquo;
said Hua, addressing the trusted <i>hoalii</i> in charge of the hunting
party&mdash;&ldquo;only from the mountains,&rdquo; he repeated;
&ldquo;I will have none from the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can they be found in the mountains?&rdquo; ventured the
<i>hoalii</i>, looking inquiringly toward Luahoomoe, who was standing
near and watching a flight of birds which seemed to be strangely
confused and ominous of evil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you inquire of me?&rdquo; said the priest, after a pause,
and finding that the king did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I inquire of any one who thinks he knows,&rdquo; returned the
<i>hoalii</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the birds you seek will not be found in the mountains at
this season of the year,&rdquo; returned the priest, &ldquo;and you
must set your snares by the sea-shore.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it so that you would attempt to countermand my
orders?&rdquo; exclaimed Hua, in apparent anger. &ldquo;I order my
servants to go to the mountains for the <i>uau</i>, and you tell them
to set their snares by the sea-shore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I humbly ask the king to remember that I have given no
orders,&rdquo; calmly replied the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have dared to interfere with mine!&rdquo; retorted
the king. &ldquo;Now listen. My men shall go to the mountains in search
of the birds I require. If they find them there I will have you slain
as a false prophet and misleader of the people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this savage threat the king walked away with his <i>hoalii</i>,
while the priest stood in silence with his face bowed to the earth. He
knew the import of Hua&rsquo;s words. They meant death to him and the
destruction of his family. The bloody purpose of the king had been told
to him at the sacrificial altar, had been seen by him in the clouds,
had been whispered to him from the <i>anu</i> of the sanctuary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the gods so will it, I must submit to the
sacrifice,&rdquo; was the pious resolution of the priest; &ldquo;but
woe to the hand that strikes, to the eyes that witness the blow, to the
land that drinks the blood of the son of Laamakua!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luahoomoe had two sons, Kaakakai and Kaanahua. Both were connected
with the priesthood, and Kaakakai had been instructed in all the
mysteries of the order in anticipation of his succession, on the death
of his father, to the position of high-priest. They were young men of
intelligence, and their lives had been blameless. Knowing that they
would not be spared, Luahoomoe advised them to leave Hana at once and
secrete themselves in the mountains, and suggested Hanaula, an elevated
spur of the mighty crater of Haleakala, as the place where they would
be most likely to escape observation.</p>
<p>But a few weeks before Kaakakai had become the husband of the
beautiful Oluolu, the daughter of a distinguished chief who had lost
his life in Hua&rsquo;s first expedition against Hilo. Twice had she
sought the <i>heiau</i> for protection against the emissaries of Hua,
who had been ordered to seize and bring her to the royal mansion, and
in both instances Luahoomoe had given her the shelter of the sacred
enclosure. It was there that Kaakakai first met her, and, charmed no
less by her beauty than her abhorrence of the lascivious intents of the
king, he soon persuaded her to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162"
href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>become his wife. But, even as
his wife, Kaakakai did not deem her secure from the evil designs of the
king, and had found an asylum for her in the humble home of a distant
relative in a secluded valley four or five miles back of Hana, where he
frequently visited her and cheered her with assurances of his love.</p>
<p>As the danger was imminent, Luahoomoe urged his sons to leave Hana
without delay, promising Kaakakai that he would visit Oluolu the next
day, and apprise her of her husband&rsquo;s flight and the place to
which he had fled for concealment. But the old priest did not live to
fulfil his promise, and Oluolu was left in ignorance of the fate of her
husband.</p>
<p>Early next morning the bird-hunters returned, bringing with them a
large number of birds, including the <i>uau</i> and <i>ulili</i>, all
of which, they averred, had been caught in the mountains, when in
reality they had been snared on the sea-shore.</p>
<p>Hua summoned the high-priest, and, pointing to the birds, said:
&ldquo;All these birds were snared in the mountains. You are therefore
condemned to die as a false prophet who has been abandoned by his gods,
and a deceiver of the people, who are entitled to the protection of
their king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking one of the birds in his hand, the priest calmly replied:
&ldquo;These birds did not come from the mountains; they are rank with
the odor of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the <i>hoalii</i> of the king steadfastly maintained that the
birds had been snared in the mountains, and Hua declared the assurance
of the hunters to be sufficient to outweigh the flimsy testimony of the
priest.</p>
<p>Luahoomoe saw that he was doomed, and that the hunters had been
schooled to sustain the lying assertion of the <i>hoalii</i>; yet he
resolved to disconcert them all and make good his position, no matter
what might be the result. He therefore asked permission to open a few
of the birds, and the king sullenly granted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Select them yourself,&rdquo; said the priest to the
<i>hoalii</i>, and the latter took from the heap and handed to him
three birds. The priest opened them, and the crops of all were found to
be filled with small fish and bits of sea-weed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold my witness!&rdquo; exclaimed the priest, pointing to
the eviscerated birds, and turning toward the <i>hoalii</i> with a look
of triumph. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>Confounded and enraged at the development, Hua seized a javelin, and
without a word savagely drove it into the breast of Luahoomoe, killing
him on the spot. A shudder ran through the witnesses as the venerable
victim fell to the earth, for violence to a high-priest was a crime
almost beyond comprehension; but the king coolly handed the bloody
weapon to an attendant, and, with a remorseless glance at the dying
priest, leisurely walked away.</p>
<p>Sending for Luuana, he immediately elevated him to the dignity of
high-priest, and ordered the body of Luahoomoe to be laid upon the
altar of the <i>heiau</i>. The house of the dead priest was then
burned, in accordance with ancient custom, and the king&rsquo;s
executioners were despatched with attendants in search of the sons of
Luahoomoe.</p>
<p>Proud of his newly-acquired honors, Luuana made preparations for
extensive sacrifices, and then proceeded to the <i>heiau</i> with the
body of Luahoomoe. As he approached the gate of the outer enclosure,
the tall <i>pea</i>, or wooden cross indicative of the sanctity of the
place, fell to the ground, and on reaching the inner court the earth
began to quake, groans issued from the carved images of the gods, and
the altar sank into the earth, leaving an opening from which issued
fire and smoke. The attendants dropped the body of the priest and fled
from the <i>heiau</i> in dismay, followed by the no less frightened
Luuana.</p>
<p>The priests of the temple, who knew nothing of the death of
Luahoomoe until they beheld his body about to be offered in sacrifice,
stood for a moment awe-stricken at what was transpiring around them.
They had been taught that the <i>heiau</i> was the only place of safety
for them in a time of danger, and after the flight of Luuana and his
attendants they tenderly conveyed the body of the high-priest to a hut
within the enclosure to prepare it for burial.</p>
<p>Luuana repaired in haste to the <i>halealii</i> to report to the
king what had occurred at the <i>heiau</i>. But his story excited but
little surprise in Hua, for events quite as overwhelming were occurring
all around them. The earth was affected with a slight but continuous
tremor; a hot and almost suffocating wind had set in from the
southward; strange murmurs were heard in the air; the skies were
crimson, and drops of blood fell from the clouds; and finally reports
came from all parts of Hana that the streams, wells and springs were no
longer yielding water, and a general flight of the people to the
mountains had commenced. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href=

<p>Such chiefs as could be found were hastily called together in
council. Hua was completely subdued, and admitted that he had angered
the gods by killing Luahoomoe. But what was to be done? Perhaps the
sons of the martyred priest might be appealed to. But where were they?
No one knew. It was suggested that a hundred human sacrifices be
offered, but Luuana declined to appear again at the <i>heiau</i>, and
resigned his office of high-priest. Another was appointed, and the
sacrifices were ceremoniously offered. The <i>mu</i> had no difficulty
in obtaining victims, for the people were desperate and offered
themselves by scores. But the drought continued, and the general
suffering increased from day to day. All other signs of the displeasure
of the gods had passed away.</p>
<p>Other sacrifices were offered in great profusion, and an
<i>imu-loa</i> was constructed, where human bodies were baked and in
that form presented to the gods. But the springs and streams, remained
dry, and the clouds dropped no rain.</p>
<p>The gods were redecorated, and the erection of a new <i>heiau</i>
was commenced, but the people remaining in the district were too few
and too weak to complete it; and a strict <i>tabu</i> was declared for
a season of ten days, but the people were too desperate to observe it,
and no attempt was made to punish those who disregarded it. Many
drowned themselves, insane from thirst, and such as could procure the
poisonous mixture died from the effects of <i>koheoheo</i> administered
by their own hands.</p>
<p>The drought extended to the mountains, and the people fled beyond;
but wherever they went the streams became dry and the rains ceased. The
pestilence became known in western Maui, and the famishing refugees
were driven back in attempting to enter that district.</p>
<p>After vainly attempting to stay the dreadful scourge, and seeing his
kingdom nearly depopulated, Hua secretly embarked with a few of his
attendants for Hawaii. He landed in the district of Kona; but the
drought followed him. Wherever he went the fresh waters sank into the
earth and the clouds yielded no rain. And so he journeyed on from place
to place, carrying famine and misery with him, until in the course of
his wanderings, occupying more than three years, he rendered almost
one-half of the island of Hawaii a desolation. Finally he died, as the
gods had decreed, of thirst and starvation&mdash;one legend says
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>in a temple of Kohala&mdash;and his bones were
left to dry in the sun; and the saying of &ldquo;rattling are the bones
of Hua in the sun,&rdquo; or &ldquo;dry are the bones of Hua in the
sun,&rdquo; has come down to the present as a significant reference to
the fate of one high in power who defied the gods and persecuted the
priesthood.</p>
<p>But rainless skies and drought did not mark alone the footsteps of
Hua and his attendants. Wherever the despairing people of the district
went the same affliction followed. Some of them sailed to Hawaii,
others to Molokai and Oahu, and a few to Kauai; but nowhere could they
find relief. Everywhere the drought kept pace with them, and famine and
suffering were the result throughout the entire group. The diviners had
discovered the cause of the scourge, but neither prayers nor sacrifices
could avert or ameliorate it. And so it continued for nearly three and
a half years.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During all the long years of famine and death what had
befallen Oluolu, the young wife of Kaakakai, left in the secluded
valley back of Hana? She saw the blight that suddenly fell upon the
land; saw the springs and streams go dry around her humble home; saw
the leaves of the banana wither and the grass turn yellow in the
valley; saw famishing men, women and children madly searching for
water, and tearing down cocoanuts for the little milk they afforded;
and then by degrees she learned of all that had transpired and was
still transpiring in Hana, including the sad story of the death of
Luahoomoe and the flight of Kaakakai. But whither had he fled? No one
could tell her; but, wherever he might be, she knew that, if alive, he
would some day return to her, and therefore struggled on as best she
could to live.</p>
<p>Her home was with Kaakao, whose wife was Mamulu. They had been
blessed with three sons, all of whom had perished in Hua&rsquo;s
useless wars, and now in their old age they were occupying a little
<i>kuleana</i>, so far up the narrow valley winding into the hills that
no land for cultivation was found above them. They had small patches of
<i>taro</i> and potatoes, a score or two of cocoanut-trees of old
growth, and plantains and bananas enough for their use. In the hills
back of them were <i>ohias</i> and other wild <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>fruits, and, with pigs and fowls in abundance,
there was never any lack of food in the house of Kaakao.</p>
<p>But when the drought came, accompanied by the scorching south wind,
Kaakao shared the fate of his neighbors. His pigs and fowls scattered
in search of water, and did not return. The ripening plantains and
bananas, together with a few bulbs of <i>taro</i>, were hastily
gathered, and the food supply stored in the house was adequate to the
wants of the occupants for some weeks to come; but fresh water was
nowhere to be found, and the cocoanuts were stripped from the trees and
laid away to meet, as far as possible, the terrible emergency.</p>
<p>Thus passed nearly half a month, during which time harrowing reports
from the valleys below reached the <i>kuleana</i> through parties
vainly searching everywhere among the hills for water. Then Kaakao saw
that his supply of cocoanut-milk was nearly exhausted, and resolved to
visit the sea-shore, where he knew of a spring in times past dripping
from the rocks almost on a level with the waves. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo;
he thought, &ldquo;that spring cannot be dry, with all the water around
it.&rdquo; And, swinging two water-calabashes over his shoulders, he
started for the sea-shore. But he never returned. In passing to the
coast he was seized, among others, and offered as a sacrifice in the
<i>heiau</i>.</p>
<p>For two days his return was awaited at the <i>kuleana</i>. Then
Mamulu solemnly said: &ldquo;Kaakao is dead. We have no more water and
but little food. Why suffer longer? Let us drink <i>koheoheo</i> and
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-day, my good friend Mamulu,&rdquo; replied Oluolu,
soothingly. &ldquo;We will talk of it to-morrow. Last night in my
dreams a whisper told me not to despair. Let us wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning Oluolu rose at daylight. The last of the
cocoanut-milk was gone, and the mouths of both were dry and feverish.
There was a strangely cheerful light in Oluolu&rsquo;s eyes as she bent
over the suffering but patient Mamulu, and, holding up a calabash,
said: &ldquo;I shall soon return with this filled with
water!&mdash;think of it, Mamulu!&mdash;filled with pure, fresh
water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; replied Mamulu, not doubting that her mind
was wandering. &ldquo;But where will you go for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a short walk&mdash;right up the valley!&rdquo; returned
Oluolu. &ldquo;You know the little cavern among the rocks. The mouth is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>almost closed, but I can find it. The water is
in the back part of the <i>ana</i>. It is running water, but it
disappears in the darkness. Perhaps it comes from <i>Po</i>; but no
matter&mdash;it is sweet and good. Luahoomoe came to me last night,
with his long, white hair smeared with blood, and told me he had sent
the water there. It is for us alone. If others know of it or taste it,
it will disappear. So we must be careful, Mamulu, very
careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the woman almost in a daze at the words thus spoken in rapid
and excited sentences, Oluolu left the hut and started up the narrow
valley. A walk of three or four minutes brought her to the entrance of
an abrupt and chasm-like ravine gashing the hills on the right. To its
almost precipitous sides clung overhanging masses of ragged volcanic
rock, from the crevices of which a sturdy vegetation had taken root,
and in time past gloomily shaded the narrow channel; but the
interlacing branches of the trees were almost leafless, and all around
were seen the footprints of death and desolation. Not a breath of wind
cooled the sultry air, and no sound of living creature broke the
silence of the heated hills. The mouth of the ravine was partially
choked with huge boulders washed down by the freshets of centuries, and
the ground was strewn with dead leaves and broken branches.</p>
<p>Casting her eyes around in every direction, to be sure that she was
not observed, Oluolu quickly found a way over the boulders and ascended
the ravine. Proceeding upward thirty or forty yards, and climbing a
rocky bench, over which in seasons of rain had poured a little cascade,
she stopped in front of an overhanging mass of vitreous rock, and the
next moment disappeared in a stooping posture through a low opening
almost concealed by decrepitations from above. The opening led to a
cavern forty or fifty feet in depth, with an irregular width almost as
great. The floor descended from the entrance, and was smooth and
apparently water-worn. Two or three steps forward enabled her to stand
upright; but all beyond was darkness, and for a moment she remained
undecided which way to proceed. She heard a sound like that of a bare
and cautious footstep on the smooth floor. She was startled, but
suffering had made her desperate, and she listened again. The same
sound continued, but it was mellowed into the soft murmur of waters
somewhere back in the darkness, and with a swelling heart she groped
her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>way toward the silvery voice, sweeter to her
than the strains of the <i>ohe</i> or the songs of birds.</p>
<p>Closer and closer she approached, every step making more distinct
the joyful music, until at last she felt the spatter of cool water upon
her bare feet. Stretching out her hand, it came in contact with a
little stream gushing from the back wall of the cavern, and instantly
disappearing where it fell upon a layer of loose gravel washed down
from the entrance. She hastily drank from her palm, and found that the
water was cool and sweet. Then she held the mouth of the calabash under
the stream, and, after wetting her head and drinking until prudence
counseled her to stop, refilled the vessel, cautiously emerged from the
opening, and hastened back to the hut.</p>
<p>Hesitating without the door, to satisfy herself that no one had
arrived during her absence, Oluolu noiselessly entered, and, stealing
to the <i>kapa-moe</i> upon which Mamulu was half-deliriously dreaming,
poured a quantity of water upon her head, and, as she opened her eyes
with a bewildered stare, dropped a swallow into her parched and open
mouth.</p>
<p>Half-rising, Mamulu dreamily felt of her dripping hair, and then
stared vacantly at Oluolu, who stood smilingly beside her with the
calabash in her hand. In a moment she recalled all that had occurred
before she dropped into the troubled sleep from which she had been so
strangely aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is not a dream!&rdquo; she murmured, clasping her
wasted hands upon her breast. &ldquo;The gods have sent us
water!&rdquo; And she reached for the calabash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Oluolu kindly, withdrawing the vessel.
&ldquo;We have plenty, but you are weak and would drink too much. Now
lie down, with this roll of <i>kapa</i> under your head, and while I am
giving you a swallow at a time I will tell you all about the water and
how I found it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, slowly feeding Mamulu with the precious fluid, and at the
same time bathing her head and throat, Oluolu related to her everything
that had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will the stream continue?&rdquo; anxiously inquired
Mamulu. &ldquo;Would it not be well to fill all the calabashes in the
house, and all we can procure, and so keep them, that we may not be
left without water should the stream disappear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would not be well to anger the gods by doubting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>them,&rdquo; replied Oluolu. &ldquo;The water
was sent, not to prolong our sufferings, but to save our lives; and I
am sure it will continue so long as we guard the secret and allow no
others to use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oluolu&rsquo;s faith was rewarded. Without any diminution in volume
the little stream continued to flow and sink in the darkness of the
cavern until the wrath of the gods was appeased and the rains finally
came again. But Oluolu and her companion could not subsist on water
alone. The parched earth produced no food; but they did not despair.
Every day they cautiously watered a little patch of mountain
<i>taro</i> in the ravine above the cavern, and at intervals of four or
five days went to the sea-shore and returned with fish, crabs, limpets
and edible sea-weed.</p>
<p>And so they managed to live without suffering, while the valleys
became almost depopulated, and all others in Hana were stricken with
famine. They seldom saw a human face in their journeys to and from the
sea, and never in the valley where they lived, and the few they met
avoided them, fearful, no doubt, that the miserable means of
subsistence to which they resorted might become known to others.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was near the end of the terrible scourge that the
district of Ewa, on the island of Oahu, became its victim. It followed
the appearance there of a Hana chief and a few of his retainers, who
had been driven from Molokai. At that time there lived at Waimalu, in
the district of Ewa, the celebrated priest and prophet Naula-a-Maihea.
No one in the Hawaiian priesthood of the past was ever more feared or
respected. It was thought by some that he had visited the shadowy
realms of <i>Milu</i>, and from <i>Paliuli</i> had brought back the
waters of life. He must have been well on in years, for, as already
mentioned, he is credited with having been the priest of Laa-mai-kahiki
on the romantic journey of that prince from the southern islands.</p>
<p>In evidence of the great sanctity of Naula, tradition relates that
his canoe was upset during a journey from Waianae, Oahu, to Kauai. He
was swallowed by a whale, in whose stomach he remained without
inconvenience until the monster crossed the channel and vomited him up
alive on the beach at Waialua, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170"
href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>Kauai, the precise place of
his destination. At another time, when crossing to Hawaii, and beset
with adverse winds, two huge black sharks, sent by <i>Mooalii</i>, the
shark-god of Molokai, towed him to Kohala so swiftly that the sea-birds
could scarcely keep him company.</p>
<p>He built a <i>heiau</i> at Waimalu, the foundations of which may
still be traced, and in the inner temple of the enclosure it is
asserted that <i>Lono</i> conversed with him freely; and at his bidding
the spirits of the living (<i>kahaoka</i>) as well as the shades of the
dead (<i>unihipili</i>) made their appearance; for it was believed by
the ancient Hawaiians that the spirits or souls of the living sometimes
separated themselves from the body during slumber or while in a
condition of trance, and became visible in distant places to priests of
especial sanctity.</p>
<p>Consulting with the gods, Naula discovered the cause of the drought,
and, becoming alarmed at the threatened destruction of the entire
population of the group, undertook to stay the ravages of the spreading
scourge. With a vision enlarged and intensified by sacrifice and
prayer, he ascended the highest peak of the Waianae Mountains. Far as
the eye could reach the skies were cloudless. He first looked toward
Kaala, but discerned no sign of rain around its wooded summits. He
turned toward Kauai, but not a cloud could be seen above the mountains
of that island. Cloudless, also, were the mountains of Molokai.
Finally, casting his eyes in the direction of Maui, he saw a small,
dark spot like a rain-cloud hanging above the peak of Hanaula.
&ldquo;It may disappear,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;I will wait.&rdquo;
Midday came. He looked again, and the spot was still there. The sun
grew red in the west. Again he looked and found that the cloud had
neither disappeared nor moved. &ldquo;Surely the sons of Luahoomoe are
there,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I will go to them; they will
listen to me, and the waters will come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naula descended from the mountain, and the same night embarked alone
in a canoe for Maui. He spread no sail, used no paddle, but all night
his <i>waa</i> skimmed the waves with the speed of the wind, and at
sunrise the next morning he landed at Makena, above which, a few miles
inland, towered the peak of Hanaula, with the dark spot still hanging
over it.</p>
<p>There, indeed, were the sons of Luahoomoe. Nurtured by the rains
that had fallen alone on the peak of Hanaula, there <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>they
had remained unseen for three and a half years, waiting for the wrath
of the gods to be appeased and for a summons to descend. A strange
light accompanied the canoe of Naula in the darkness. From their
elevated retreat they noted it far out upon the ocean, and watched it
growing brighter as it approached, until it went out on the beach at
Makena. They knew it to be the signal of their deliverance, and
hastened down the mountain to meet the messenger of the gods. One
account says they met Naula at Kula; but the meeting occurred not far
from the Makena landing, where the priest, inspired with a knowledge of
their coming, awaited their arrival. As they approached, the venerable
<i>kahuna</i>, his white hair and beard falling to his waist and a
<i>tabu</i> staff in his hand, advanced to meet them. They bowed
respectfully, and, returning the salutation, Naula said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you to be the sons of Luahoomoe, whose death by the
hands of Hua, King of Hana, has been avenged by the gods upon the
people of all the islands of Hawaii. The earth is still parched, and
thousands are seeking in vain for food and water. Hua is dead; his
bones lie unburied in the sun. Scattered or dead are the people of
Hana; their lands are yellow, and their springs and streams yield
nothing but dust and ashes. Great was the crime of Hua, and great has
been the punishment. I am Naula-a-Maihea, the high-priest of Oahu, and
have come to ask, with you, that the gods may be merciful and no longer
scourge the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the mention of his name the sons of Luahoomoe bowed low before
the aged prophet of whose sanctity report had years before apprised
them, and then Kaakakai replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great priest, willingly will we add our voices to your
supplication to the gods, whose vengeance has indeed been terrible. But
since our retreat was revealed to you and nothing seems to be hidden
from your understanding, let me ask if you know aught of the fate of
Oluolu. She was my wife, and I left her in a little valley in the
mountains back of Hana. I loved her greatly, and am grieved with the
fear that she is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without replying the priest seated himself upon the ground, and,
unbinding the <i>kihei</i> from his shoulders, threw it over his head,
shutting the light from his face. While one hand pressed the mantle
closely to his breast, the other held to his forehead what seemed to be
a talisman of stone suspended by a short <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>cord from his neck.
He remained motionless in that position for some minutes; then throwing
off the <i>kihei</i> and rising to his feet, he turned to Kaakakai and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not wrong in my thought. The presence here of the sons
of Luahoomoe has sanctified the spot to communion with the spirits of
the air. Oluolu, alone with a woman much her elder, still lives where
you left her and hopefully awaits the coming of Kaakakai&mdash;for such
I now know to be your name. The spirit of Luahoomoe has nourished and
protected her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Naula, most favored of the gods!&rdquo; exclaimed
Kaakakai, grasping the hand of the priest. &ldquo;You have made my
heart glad! Now ask of me what you will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the very spot from which the priest had risen they proceeded to
erect a rude altar of stones. When it was completed Naula brought from
his canoe a combined image of the godhead&mdash;the <i>Oie</i> of the
early priesthood&mdash;and a small enclosed calabash of holy
water&mdash;<i>ka-wai-kapu-a-Kane</i>. Removing the <i>kapa</i>
covering, the image was placed beside the altar, and while the priest
recited the solemn <i>kaiokopeo</i>, or prayer of consecration,
Kaakakai intoned the invocation and continued at intervals to sprinkle
the altar with holy water.</p>
<p>The dedication ceremonies were at length concluded; but what was
there to offer as a sacrifice? The hills were bare and parched. Far as
the eye could reach the lands were deserted, and no living thing beside
themselves was visible. Suddenly there appeared among the leafless
shrubbery near them a large black hog sacred to sacrifice. The brothers
exchanged looks of wonder, but the priest did not seem to be greatly
surprised. The animal was immediately seized, killed and placed upon
the altar, and sacrificial prayers were devoutly offered.</p>
<p>In the midst of these services a wind set in from the south. Black
clouds began to gather, from which the answering voice of thunder came,
and then a gentle rain began to fall upon the sere and hungry earth.
Raising his face into the baptism, Naula with emotion exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sacrifice is accepted! The gods are merciful, and the
people are saved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the rains continued, not there alone but all over the islands,
until the grass grew green again and the banana put forth its shoots.
Everywhere the rejoicing was great. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>people returned to
their deserted lands, and the valleys of Hana, even, blossomed as
before. But Hua and his family had perished from the earth, and a new
dynasty came into being to claim the sovereignty of eastern Maui.</p>
<p>The sons of the martyred Luahoomoe returned at once to Hana, and in
the arms of Kaakakai the brave and faithful Oluolu recited the story of
her sufferings and deliverance. With largely-augmented possessions
Kaakakai became the high-priest under the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, and
for generations his descendants continued to be among the most
influential of the families of eastern Maui. Kaanahua became the god of
the husbandman.</p>
<p>The political events immediately following the death of Hua are but
vaguely referred to by tradition, and the few particulars known
doubtless owe their preservation to the care taken by the
priesthood&mdash;to which class the historians of the past usually
belonged&mdash;to bring down, with all its terrible details, the fate
of Hua, as a warning to succeeding sovereigns who might be disposed to
trespass upon the sacred domain of the spiritual rulers who, in a
measure, divided the allegiance of their subjects. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Two or three attempts to consolidate under one general
government the several islands of the Hawaiian group were made by
ambitious and war-like chiefs previous to the final accomplishment of
the project, at the close of the last century, by Kamehameha I.; but
all these early schemes of conquest and aggrandizement proved
unsuccessful, and were especially unfortunate in affording excuses for
retaliatory raids and invasions, sometimes extending, with more or less
persistency and bitterness, to generations thereafter.</p>
<p>The most disastrous of these ambitious ventures was the first, and
connected with it were a number of strange and dramatic incidents,
giving to the story of the enterprise something more than a historic
interest. It occurred in about <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1260, and
the bold warrior who attempted it was Kalaunuiohua, king of the island
of Hawaii. He was the grandson of Kalapana, who reconquered the kingdom
from Kamaiole, the usurper, as related in the story of &ldquo;The Royal
Hunchback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time Kamaluohua, the seventh in descent from Paumakua, was
the <i>moi</i> of Maui, or rather of the western and greater part of
the island. Huapouleilei, the eighth in line from Maweke, was the
<i>alii-nui</i> of Oahu, his possessions embracing the districts of
Ewa, Waianae and Waialua, while the Koolau and Kona divisions were
ruled, respectively, by Moku-a-Loe and Kahuoi. The <i>moi</i> of
Molokai was Kahokuohua, the fourth in descent in the old Nanaula line
from Keoloewa, the brother of Kaupeepee, the abductor of Hina and
desperate defender of the fortress of Haupu, as told in the legend of
&ldquo;Hina, the Hawaiian Helen.&rdquo; Kukona was the sovereign of
Kauai. He was the great-grandson of Ahukini-a-Laa, one of the three
sons of the three wives of Laa-mai-kahiki, as mentioned in the story of
&ldquo;The Triple Marriage of Laa-mai-kahiki.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span></p>
<p>The contemporary rulers of the several islands are thus referred to
for the reason that they all appear as prominent actors in the several
legends from which have been gathered the historic features of the
story about to be related, and also for the purpose of keeping
partially in view the conspicuous and succeeding representatives of the
sovereign families of the group.</p>
<p>Kalaunuiohua&mdash;or, as he will be called hereafter,
Kalaunui&mdash;inherited something of the military spirit of his
warlike grandfather, and is referred to by tradition as an ambitious
and aggressive sovereign, courageous in enterprise, but lacking in
judgment and discretion. This estimate of his character is abundantly
sustained by the record of his acts.</p>
<p>Waipio had been made the focus of sovereign authority by
Kahaimoelea, the royal father of Kalaunui, and continued to be the most
attractive and consequential point in the kingdom. The royal grounds
and edifices had been enlarged and improved from time to time, until
barbaric taste and skill seemed to be able to add nothing more to their
grandeur or beauty. Not far from the royal mansion was the great
<i>heiau</i> of Pakaalani, partially built by Kalapana, and completed
by his successor. Its <i>tabus</i> were the most sacred on Hawaii, and
a descendant of Paao officiated there as high-priest. It was connected
with the palace enclosure by a sacred stone pavement, which it was
death for any but royal and privileged feet to touch, and on its walls
were over a hundred gods.</p>
<p>Kalaunui was proud of his ancestry, which carried back his lineage
both to Pili and Maweke, and united in his veins the foremost blood of
the pioneers of the fifth and eleventh centuries. He had two
children&mdash;a son named Kuaiwa, and a daughter, Kapapa, whose full
name was Kapapalimulimu. At the time of which we are writing she was
fifteen, and her brother was three or four years older. Both had been
carefully reared. The son had been instructed in all the manly
accomplishments of the time, and from her infancy the daughter had been
guarded with the most jealous watchfulness. She had grown almost to
womanhood without betrothal, for the reason that a husband suited to
her rank and personally deserving of her beauty could with difficulty
be found in the kingdom.</p>
<p>Among the number of the king&rsquo;s retainers of various grades of
rank&mdash;beginning with the <i>wohi</i>, or chief counsellor of royal
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>blood next to the throne, and ending with the
<i>kahu-alii</i> and <i>puuku</i>, or personal and other attendants at
the palace&mdash;was the young chief Kualu. He was large, muscular and
handsome, with a bearing indicative of good blood, and through his
courage and capacity at arms had been raised to the military position
of <i>pukaua</i>, or captain, and placed in charge of the palace
guard&mdash;an office which gave him, if he did not before possess it,
the privilege of an <i>aialo</i>, or the right to eat food in the
presence of the king.</p>
<p>Kualu was a chief without possessions. His grandfather, a chief of
the old line of Nanaula, had been killed in the battle which restored
Kalapana to the throne of his fathers, and on the sudden death of his
father, twenty years before, he had been adopted by Waahia, a
<i>kaula</i>, or prophetess, renowned in tradition for her foresight
and influence. He was recognized by the <i>Aha-alii</i>, or college of
chiefs of established lineage, as of noble blood, but belonged to that
class of chiefs who, lacking the influence of family and estates, were
compelled to rely upon their own efforts for advancement.</p>
<p>Although it is claimed that Waahia was of chiefly lineage, nothing
is positively known, even of her parents. She first appeared in Waipio
more than a generation before, and, through an almost undeviating
verification of her prophecies, in time became noted and feared by the
people, not only as a favored devotee of <i>Uli</i>, the god of the
sorcerers, but as a medium through whom the <i>unipihili</i>, or
spirits of the dead, communicated. She lived alone in a hut in a
retired part of the valley of Waipio, and it is said that a large
<i>pueo</i>, or owl, which, with the white <i>alae</i>, was sacred and
sometimes worshipped, came nightly and perched upon the roof of her
lonely habitation.</p>
<p>Of course a <i>kaula</i> of her sanctity wanted for nothing. The
people were only too happy to leave at her door anything of which she
might stand in need, and the best of everything in the valley came
unbidden to her board. Of her abundance she gave to the needy, and,
while she seldom spoke to any one, her looks and acts were kind to all.
The priesthood recognized her power, and the king and chiefs consulted
her in matters of moment when the <i>kilos</i> of the temple were in
doubt.</p>
<p>She had reared Kualu with the greatest care, and saw him grow to a
manhood of which she was proud. She loved him as if he had been her own
child, and he repaid her affection by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>heeding her advice in
all things, and by kindness comforting her declining years. She had
schooled him in a lore which but few possessed, and the most skilful
had instructed him in the martial and courtly accomplishments
consistent with his chiefly rank. At the age of twenty he became
attached to the household of the king, and in time was advanced, as
already stated, to the high grade of captain of the palace guard.
Although his abilities had commended him to advancement, his early
favor with the king was doubtless due to some extent to the influence
of his foster-mother.</p>
<p>Kualu&rsquo;s intimate connection with the royal household brought
him into frequent companionship with Kuaiwa and his sister, and as the
latter grew to womanhood a romantic attachment sprang up between her
and the handsome captain of the guard. It was romantic only because it
was to every appearance hopeless, for there was a wide gulf between
Kualu and the daughter of the proudest <i>moi</i> in all the group, and
for whom there seemed to be no fitting mate.</p>
<p>The home of Kualu was within the palace enclosure; yet he frequently
visited Waahia in her lonely retreat, to cheer her with words of
affection and see that she wanted for nothing. It was during one of
these visits, not long before the beginning of the leading events of
this legend, that the <i>kaula</i> abruptly said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kualu, I can see that you are thinking much of
Kapapa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sometimes meet,&rdquo; replied Kualu, evasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not well for you to try to gather berries from the
clouds,&rdquo; returned the <i>kaula</i>, kindly. &ldquo;A
<i>niapio</i> of the highest rank alone can reach that
fruit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flying spear brings down what the hand cannot
reach,&rdquo; was Kualu&rsquo;s significant answer.</p>
<p>Waahia smiled at the dauntless spirit of her ward, and after a long
pause, during which she sat thoughtfully, with her eyes fixed upon the
ground, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your hopes are bold, but the gods are great. Come to me
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Kualu was made joyful by the words of Waahia. She told
him that she had been given a view of something of his future, and that
the auguries promised so much that she could not discourage even the
most audacious of his aspirations; but <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>that coming events
affecting his life were so mingled with wars, and strange faces of a
race she had never seen except in dreams, that she could then advise no
definite course of action.</p>
<p>With these vague words of encouragement Kualu returned to the
palace, and authoritatively learned, what had for some time been
rumored, that preparations were to be speedily made for an invasion of
Maui, and possibly of the other islands of the group. Having brought
all the districts of Hawaii under his control, Kalaunui entertained the
ambitious design of uniting the several islands of the archipelago
under one government. In this grand scheme of conquest and
consolidation he was sustained by the leading chiefs of Hawaii,
hungering for foreign possessions, and large quotas of canoes and
warriors were promised.</p>
<p>A general plan of action having been adopted, a fleet of two
thousand canoes of all sizes and an army of twelve thousand warriors
were speedily collected. Sacrifices were made at the great temple of
Pakaalani; the favor of the gods was invoked, and the auguries were
satisfactory. The king was to lead the expedition in person, and the
chivalry of the kingdom rallied to his support. His double canoe,
nearly forty paces in length, was gorgeous in royal colors and
trappings, and more than a hundred others bore at their mast-heads the
ensigns of distinguished chiefs. No such warlike display had been seen
by the generation witnessing it, and the confidence and enthusiasm of
the king and his commanding officers were fully shared by the
people.</p>
<p>Leaving the government in the hands of his young son Kuaiwa, with
Kaheka, the queen-mother, as principal adviser, Kalaunui ordered the
warriors to their canoes, and with his aids and personal attendants
repaired to the beach to superintend the departure of the expedition in
person. In charge of his high-priest, his newly-decorated war-god had
been taken aboard, and the king was about to follow, when Waahia, whose
foster-son was one of the leaders in the enterprise, approached the
royal <i>kaulua</i>. She was clad in a <i>pau</i> and short mantle, and
her long, white hair fell below her shoulders. Her form was bent, and
she carried a staff for support.</p>
<p>At the sight of the venerable figure, familiar to every one in
Waipio, the king turned and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you are here. Encouragement comes from the temple.
What says Waahia?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href=
"#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good in the beginning! bad in the end!&rdquo; was the blunt
response of the prophetess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am instructed by your cheering assurances,&rdquo; adroitly
returned the king, observing that her words had been overheard.
&ldquo;The true meaning is that it would be bad to abruptly end a good
beginning.&rdquo; Saying which, with something of a scowl he hastily
stepped into his <i>kaulua</i> and gave the signal for departure.</p>
<p>Without replying, Waahia, fully believing that disaster would
overtake the expedition in the end, and anxious to be near Kualu when
it came, entered one of the many canoes set apart for the women and
other camp-followers of the invading army, and with the fleet set sail
for Maui.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While the Hawaiian army, cheered by chants of battle
and beating of war-drums, is buffeting the waves on its way to Maui,
let us glance again at the <i>moi</i> of that island and the political
condition of his possessions. While Kamaluohua was the nominal
sovereign of the island, the extreme eastern portion of it continued to
be governed by independent chiefs. The principal chief of the windward
side was Wakalana, whose residence was at Wailuku. He was a cousin of
the <i>moi</i>, and their relations were exceedingly friendly.</p>
<p>Two years before a remarkable event had occurred at Wailuku. It was
the second appearance in the group of a vessel bearing people of a
strange race, described by tradition as &ldquo;white, with bright,
shining eyes.&rdquo; Mention is made of other white people who were
brought to the islands on one or more occasions by the argonauts of
earlier generations, notably by Paumakua, of Oahu, who near the close
of the eleventh century returned from one of his exploring voyages with
three white persons of an unknown race; but this was the second time
that a vessel of a people other than Polynesian had been seen in
Hawaiian waters. The first made a landing near Makapu Point, on the
island of Oahu, more than a hundred years before. Tradition has
preserved the name of the vessel (<i>Ulupana</i>) and of the captain
(<i>Mololano</i>) and his wife (<i>Malaea</i>); but as it is not
mentioned that they remained in the country, it is probable that they
soon re-embarked. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183"
name="pb183">183</a>]</span></p>
<p>The second arrival is more distinctly marked by tradition. It was a
Japanese vessel that had been dismantled by a typhoon, driven toward
the North American coast until it encountered the northwest
trade-winds, and then helplessly blown southward to the coast of Maui.
It was late in the afternoon that word had been brought to Wakalana
that a strange vessel was approaching the coast. As it was high out of
water and drifting broadside before the wind, it appeared to be of
great size, and little disposition was shown by the people to go out in
their canoes to meet the mysterious monster. Wakalana hastened to the
beach, and, after watching the vessel intently for some time, saw that
it was drifting slowly toward the rocky coast to the westward. Seaman
enough to know that certain destruction awaited it in that direction,
Wakalana hastily manned a stout canoe and started out to sea in
pursuit. The waters were rough and his progress was slow, but he
succeeded in reaching the vessel a few minutes after it struck the
cliffs and was dashed in pieces. Seizing whatever they could find to
assist them in floating, those on board leaped into the sea. It was
hazardous to approach the wreck too nearly, but Wakalana succeeded in
rescuing from the waves and returning to Wailuku with five persons, but
not before he saw the last fragment of the wreck disappear in the abyss
of raging waters.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the names preserved, either of the vessel or its
rescued passengers, to indicate their nationality. The name of the
vessel is given as <i>Mamala</i>, which in the Hawaiian might mean a
wreck or fragment. The name of the captain was Kaluikia-Manu; the four
others were called Neleike, Malaea, Haakoa and Hika&mdash;all names of
Hawaiian construction. Two of them&mdash;Neleike and Malaea&mdash;were
women, the former being the sister of the captain.</p>
<p>They landed almost without clothing, and the only novelties upon
their persons were the rings and bracelets of the women, and a sword in
the belt of the captain, with which he had thoughtlessly leaped into
the sea from the sinking vessel. They were half-famished and weak, and
by gestures expressed their gratitude to Wakalana for his gallantry in
rescuing them, and asked for food and water. Both were provided in
abundance, and two houses were set apart for their occupation. They
attracted great attention, and people came from all parts of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>island to see the white strangers. It was noted
with astonishment by the natives that these men and women ate from the
same vessels, and that nothing was especially <i>tabu</i> to either
sex; but Wakalana explained that their gods doubtless permitted such
freedom, and they should therefore not be rebuked for their apparent
disregard of Hawaiian custom.</p>
<p>The comfort of the strangers was made the especial care of Wakalana,
and they soon became not only reconciled but apparently content with
their situation. But the kindness of the chief, however commendable,
was not altogether unselfish. He was charmed with the bright eyes and
fair face of Neleike, the sister of the captain. He found a pleasure
that was new to him in teaching her to speak his language, and almost
the first use she made of <i>oia</i> was to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; with
it when he asked her to become his wife. Her marriage was followed by
that of Malaea to a native chief, and of her brother and his two male
companions to native women of good family. And here, as well as
anywhere, it may be mentioned that, through her son Alooia, Neleike
became the progenitor of a family which for generations showed the
marks of her blood, and that the descendants of the others were
plentiful thereafter, not only on Maui but in the neighborhood of
Waimalo, on the island of Oahu.</p>
<p>The object of the rescued Japanese which attracted most attention
was the sword accidentally preserved by the captain. No such terrible
knife had ever before been seen or dreamed of by the natives. They had
<i>pahoas</i>, or daggers of wood or ivory, and knives of sharply
broken flint and sharks&rsquo; teeth; they had stone adzes, axes,
hatchets and hammers, with which they could fell trees, hollow canoes
from tree-trunks, build houses, manufacture implements of war and
industry, and hew stone of softer composition; they had spears and
javelins with points of seasoned wood hard enough to splinter a bone;
but iron and other metals had for ages been practically unknown to
their race, and the long, sharp sword of the captain, harder than bone
or seasoned wood, and from its polished surface throwing defiantly back
the bright rays of the sun, engaged their ceaseless wonder and
admiration. As an ornament they regarded it with longing, and when they
learned that it was a weapon of war they felt that the arm that wielded
it in battle must be unconquerable.</p>
<p>The captain did not see fit to disabuse the minds of the
superstitious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>natives in their disposition to attribute a
power of almost unlimited slaughter to the simple weapon. On the
contrary, he rarely exhibited it except to distinguished chiefs, and in
a few months it began to be mentioned as a sacred gift of the gods and
pledge of victory to him who possessed it. Nor was the knowledge of the
existence of a talisman so wonderful long confined to the windward side
of Maui. The fame of the terrible weapon spread from Hana to Kaanapali,
and thence to the other islands of the group; and if but few of the
many who came to learn the truth of the report were favored with a view
of the sword, all saw, at least, the strange people who were pointed
out as the bearers of it from an unknown land, and the story of its
powers was readily accepted. But he who possessed it did not come as a
conqueror, and, as he showed no disposition to use it offensively, the
weapon ceased to be regarded with alarm.</p>
<p>And now we will return to Kalaunui and his army of conquest, last
seen on their way to Maui in a fleet of two thousand canoes. Sailing to
the western division of the island, which was reached in two days,
Kalaunui effected a landing of his army at Lahaina. Kamaluohua, the
<i>moi</i> of the island, had learned of the projected invasion some
days before, and made every preparation possible to meet and repel it.
<i>Lunapais</i>, or war-messengers, had been despatched to the several
district chiefs, and an army of seven or eight thousand warriors of all
arms had been hastily collected. Wakalana had gone to the general
defence with a force of eight hundred men, including Kaluiki, the
Japanese captain, upon whose presence great reliance was placed by the
warriors of Wailuku, if not by Wakalana himself.</p>
<p>Unable to land at Lahaina, which was in possession of the enemy,
Kamaluohua marched his forces across the mountains, and a sanguinary
battle was fought in the neighborhood of the village. But the Mauians,
greatly outnumbered, were defeated and driven back to the hills, and
their king was taken prisoner. Throughout the battle Kualu was
especially conspicuous for his might and courage. Armed with a huge
stone axe, everything human seemed to fall before him, and where he led
the bravest alone followed, for he sought the very heart of danger.</p>
<p>The conflict was drawing to a close. The <i>moi</i>, gallantly
fighting, had been taken prisoner, and his decimated battalions were
steadily giving way, when Kualu encountered a body of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>two
or three hundred men resolutely defending themselves behind a low stone
wall. Several ineffectual attempts to dislodge them had been made, and
they were sending forth shouts of victory and defiance. Something had
inspired them with unusual courage and confidence. Did Kualu divine
what it was? Perhaps he did, for, hastily rallying to his support a
force of sturdy warriors, he fought his way over the wall, and a
determined hand-to-hand struggle followed. Meantime a flanking party of
spearsmen had made a circuit around the wall and were menacing its
defenders in the rear. Observing the peril of the situation, and that
an effort was being made to cut off their retreat to the hills, the
Mauians began to fall back. As they did so Kualu was seen to dash
forward and precipitate himself, almost unsupported, upon a score or
two of warriors who had apparently rallied to the assistance of some
chief in distress. Regardless of danger, he hewed his way through the
battling throng until he stood face to face with Kaluiki, the white
captain, in whose hand was the shining blade which had so nerved the
arms of the warriors of Wailuku. With a blow of his battle-axe he
struck the sword from the upraised hand of the strange warrior. As it
fell to the earth he placed his foot upon it, and yielded no ground
until the tide of battle swept around and past him, forcing to retreat
the last to present a hostile front of the army of the captive king of
Maui.</p>
<p>Left alone for a moment by the wild pursuit of the flying enemy,
Kualu hurriedly stooped and thrust the sword into the earth, pressing
it downward until the hilt was covered; then, placing a large rock upon
the spot, he left the field, numbering, as he went, his paces to the
wall behind which the Mauians had sought protection.</p>
<p>The victory was complete. The <i>moi</i> was a prisoner, and such of
his army as had not escaped to the hills lay dead on the field. The
country was given over to pillage, and at sunset twenty prisoners were
slain and sacrificed in a <i>heiau</i> near the village. The sacrifices
were made to his war-god, and Kalaunui witnessed the solemn ceremonies
of the offering.</p>
<p>The night was spent in the wildest revelry by the victorious
warriors, in the midst of which Kualu sought his foster-mother, who,
with the women and non-combatants of the invading army, was encamped
near the canoes on the beach. He hastily recited <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>to
her the events of the day, and concluded with the information that he
had captured the long, bright knife of the strange chief of Wailuku,
and, believing it to be of great value, had hidden it in the earth. At
this intelligence the eyes of Waahia flashed with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done well,&rdquo; said the <i>kaula</i>, rising to
her feet. &ldquo;I have seen that long knife in my dreams. It will have
much to do with your future. But it will be unsafe in your possession.
Give it to me. Give it to me at once,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;for
should Kalaunui by any chance learn that it was taken in battle, he
will claim it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am sure no one saw me hide it,&rdquo; replied
Kualu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk like a boy,&rdquo; returned Waahia. &ldquo;You must
be sure of nothing of which there is a possibility of doubt. But no
matter. It is not too dark to find the spot to-night. Let us go to it
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Excited by her words, Kualu now became no less anxious than the
<i>kaula</i> that the sword should be placed in her keeping, and in an
indirect way, to avoid observation, they repaired to the battle-field.
Their only light was that of the stars, and after reaching the wall it
was some time before Kualu was able to identify the exact place to
which he had extended the line of his hasty measurement. The ground was
strewn with the naked bodies of the slain, and occasional groans came
from a few whose struggles with death were not quite over. But no
emotion, either of dread or pity, disturbed the visitors.</p>
<p>Satisfied at length that he had found the desired place in the wall,
Kualu took a careful bearing, and then stepped briskly toward the
north, closely followed by Waahia. Measuring a hundred paces or more,
he suddenly stopped, and with alarm discovered what seemed to be the
form of a man crouching beside the rock marking the spot where the
sword had been buried. Grasping his <i>pahoa</i>&mdash;the only weapon
he had brought with him&mdash;Kualu sprang forward and placed his hand
upon the object. It was cold and motionless; and the young warrior
smiled as the thought came to him that some one of the many who had
fallen under his axe that day had possibly crawled to the spot to guard
his treasure in death. He lifted the body aside, removed the stone, and
the next moment pulled from the earth and handed to Waahia the iron
blade. She grasped it eagerly, and, with a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>hasty glance at its bright blade glistening in
the starlight, wrapped it securely in a piece of <i>kapa</i> and placed
it under her mantle.</p>
<p>Without attracting especial notice they returned to the beach. When
importuned by Kualu to tell him something definite of his future,
Waahia revealed to him much that would happen; but all had not yet been
given to her, and she admonished him to keep his lips closed and
patiently await the development of the will of the gods. &ldquo;I can
see victories to come,&rdquo; said the <i>kaula</i>, &ldquo;but in the
end defeat and disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if disaster is to come to us in the end,&rdquo; suggested
Kualu, &ldquo;why should it not mean defeat and death to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can give no reason why it should not; but the gods seldom
explain their acts to mortals, and I am content in seeing your star
shining above the ruin of Kalaunui.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spoke the <i>kaula</i>, and, cheered by her words, Kualu sought
his tent of mats, and on a hard couch of <i>kapa</i> dreamed of a long,
bright knife, and of battles in which he hewed down armies with it.</p>
<p>Taking his royal captive with him, the second day after the battle
Kalaunui set sail with his army for the island of Molokai, of which
Kahokuohua was the <i>alii-nui</i>, or governing chief. No force
adequate to cope with the invading army could be rallied; but the
chivalrous descendant of the ancient kings of Hawaii was not a ruler to
allow his subjects to be plundered without resistance, and, hastily
gathering an army of four or five thousand warriors, he gave the
invaders battle at Kalaupapa. But he was defeated and taken prisoner,
and after ravaging the country for miles around, and destroying every
captured canoe of which he could make no use, Kalaunui sailed for the
conquest of Oahu with the two royal captives in his train.</p>
<p>Waahia still accompanied the expedition. But the iron knife was not
with her. The king had from some source learned that its glitter had
been seen on the battle-field at Lahaina, and she had hidden it in a
cleft of the black rocks of the <i>pali</i> encircling Kalaupapa.</p>
<p>As already stated, Oahu was at that time governed by a number of
practically independent chiefs. The most powerful of these, and
possibly recognized <i>alii-nui</i> of the island, was Huapouleilei,
chief of the Ewa and Waianae districts, to which division Kalaunui
directed his fleet. Landing his forces at <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>Waianae, a sanguinary
battle was fought near that place, resulting in the defeat of the
Oahuans and the capture of Huapouleilei.</p>
<p>Elated with his successes, and deeming himself invincible, Kalaunui
next prepared for a descent upon Kauai and the conquest of the entire
group. But his plans for so formidable an undertaking were faulty. He
took no steps to consolidate his conquests or maintain possession of
the lands subdued by his arms. He left behind him no friend or
stronghold on the conquered islands, blindly trusting, no doubt, that
in the persons of his royal prisoners he retained, for the time being,
a sufficiently firm hold upon their lands and subjects.</p>
<p>Before embarking for Kauai elaborate sacrifices were offered, and
every device known to the priesthood was exhausted to secure a
continuance of the favor of the gods. The <i>moi</i> of that island was
Kukona, the fourth in descent from the great Laa-mai-kahiki. Kalaunui
recognized that the defensive resources of Kauai were not to be
despised, but he as greatly underrated the military abilities of Kukona
as he overrated his own, and therefore did not doubt the result.</p>
<p>Waahia saw disaster approaching, but knew that Kalaunui would not
listen to her voice of warning, and therefore remained silent when the
<i>kilos</i>, anxious to please the king, shaped their inauspicious
auguries into promises of victory. Her greatest solicitude was for
Kualu. He had been entrusted with an important command, and could find
no honorable pretext for declining to accept the hazard of the final
struggle on Kauai. Waahia, therefore, did not advise him to remain, for
she had seen his star shining above the clouds of defeat. She had
sought frequent and earnest counsel of the mysterious intelligences of
the earth and air. She had seen their answers in the smoke of burning
incense, and within the circle of blood at midnight, when the moon was
dark, had heard their whispers. Hence it was with confidence that she
said to Kualu, on the evening before the departure of the fleet for
Kauai:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you must go. I can be of no service to you where the air
will be filled with spears and the canoes will be painted red with
blood. I will return to Hawaii. You will be defeated. Kukona is a brave
and skilful warrior, and the army of Kalaunui. will be rent in pieces
and thrown into the sea. The slaughter <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>will be great, but
circumstances will open a way and you will escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And should I escape, where will I find you?&rdquo; inquired
Kualu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the owls in the old hut in Waipio,&rdquo; replied the
<i>kaula</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the long knife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The long knife is where I alone can find it,&rdquo; answered
Waahia. &ldquo;Leave the secret to me; it will be of service to us
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early next morning the army of Kalaunui set sail for Kauai, and with
it, as prisoners, the <i>mois</i> of Maui and Molokai and the
<i>alii-nui</i> of Oahu. At the same time Waahia embarked for Hawaii,
taking with her the war-god of the king. Traditions differ concerning
the circumstances under which the god was delivered to the prophetess.
One asserts that she refused to hold her peace or leave the expedition
without it; another that the king, annoyed by her ill-omened words and
presence, purchased her departure with it; and a third that it was
given to her in deference to her declaration that, if taken to Kauai,
it would not return except at the head of a conquering army that would
make a tributary kingdom of Hawaii. Certain it is, however, that Waahia
returned to Hawaii from Oahu with the war-god of the king. It was the
sacred <i>Akuapaao</i>, or war-god of Paao, and was held in great
reverence by the priesthood. Borne over the waters by unseen forces,
the canoe of Waahia was stranded on the beach at Koholalele, on the
island of Hawaii. Not far off was the old <i>heiau</i> of Manini, and
thither the god was conveyed, and placed in the custody of the
high-priest of the temple, with the injunction that it was never to be
removed from the inner court, or sanctuary, unless the kingdom was in
peril. Six generations after it was taken from the <i>heiau</i> by the
giant Maukaleoleo, and carried at the head of the victorious army of
Umi, as mentioned in the legend of &ldquo;Umi, the Peasant Prince of
Hawaii.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five hundred canoes had been added to the fleet of Kalaunui, and the
imposing squadron seemed to stretch half across the wide channel
separating the two islands. A landing was made at Koloa, and the entire
army disembarked without opposition. The district seemed to be
deserted, and not a hostile spear was visible. And so continued the
peaceful aspect until daylight the next morning, when Kukona, supported
by every prominent chief of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href=
"#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>Kauai, suddenly precipitated upon
the invaders from the surrounding hills an army of ten thousand
warriors. Nor this alone. Along the westward coast was seen approaching
a fleet of nearly a thousand war-canoes, with the manifest design of
capturing or destroying the canoes of the Hawaiians and cutting off
their retreat by sea. Hastily forming his lines to meet the avalanche
from the hills, Kalaunui despatched Kualu to the beach with a force of
three thousand warriors to protect the canoes.</p>
<p>The attacks by land and sea were almost simultaneous, and the battle
was one of the most stubborn and sanguinary ever fought in the group.
As predicted by Waahia, the air was filled with spears and the canoes
were painted red with blood. Standing in the water to their hips, Kualu
and his warriors met their enemies as they attempted to land, and a
struggle of the wildest description followed. Canoes were upset; men
were hauled into them and killed, and out of them and drowned, and for
a distance of three or four hundred yards in the surf along the beach
raged a desperate conflict, dreadful even to savage eyes. In their fury
they fought in, above and under the water, and hundreds fiercely
grappled and without a wound sank to their deaths together. Neither
would yield, and in the end resistance ceased, and Kualu saw the beach
strewn with dead, a thousand tenantless canoes idly playing with the
surf, and less than as many hundreds of warriors left as he had led
thousands into the fight. He had saved the fleet, but the sacrifice of
life had been terrible.</p>
<p>Despatching a messenger to the king, and speedily reorganizing the
remnant of his force, Kualu was about to leave the beach for service
where he might most be needed, when he discovered, with horror, that
the Hawaiian army had been defeated, and in scattered fragments was
seeking flight in all directions. Harassed by pursuit, a thousand or
more were fighting and struggling to reach the beach. Satisfied that
the battle was lost, to facilitate the escape of the fugitives Kualu
ordered a large number of canoes to be hastily equipped and launched,
and then started back to assist in covering the retreat. But his men
refused to follow him. Knowing the danger of delay, all but a few of
them leaped into canoes and paddled out to sea. As he could do nothing
more, he selected a canoe suitable to the four persons who were to
occupy it, and with his three remaining companions passed through the
surf and headed for Oahu. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href=
"#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span></p>
<p>Kualu did not escape a moment too soon. He had scarcely stemmed the
surf before the fugitives, abandoning all defence, made a precipitate
dash for the canoes, closely followed by their pursuers. In their haste
they shoved out in canoes some of which were overburdened and others
but half-manned. A number of the former foundered in the surf, and such
of the latter as succeeded in passing the breakers were overtaken by
the canoes sent in pursuit. Nor did but few escape of the two or three
hundred who preceded Kualu in his flight. Some of them embarked in
double canoes which they were unable to manage, and others were either
without sails or short of paddles. The result was that less than a
hundred of the fugitives escaped capture, and of that number probably
not more than twenty or thirty succeeded in reaching the other islands
of the group, for the sea was rough and but few of them were skilled in
navigation. Among these were Kualu and his companions.</p>
<p>Almost from the beginning the sudden attack of Kukona from the hills
had been a slaughter. The withdrawal of three thousand spears for the
protection of his canoes had weakened the lines of Kalaunui at an
exposed point, and, breaking through them, the Kauaians so vigorously
followed up the advantage that no effort could save the Hawaiians from
defeat. They fought bravely and with desperation; but the breaking of
their lines had left them without any definite plan of action, and
defeat was inevitable. Kalaunui&rsquo;s courage was conspicuous, but
after an hour&rsquo;s hopeless struggle he saw his brave battalions
melting to the earth and giving way at all points. Recognizing that the
battle was lost, and that what was left of his army would soon be in
wild retreat, he attempted to cut his way through to the beach, but was
intercepted and taken prisoner. Learning his rank, he was taken by his
captors to Kukona, and a few minutes later the royal chiefs of Maui,
Molokai and Oahu, with their arms corded behind their backs, appeared
on the scene. Deserted by their guards, they had been found in a hut
not far from the beach and brought to the victorious <i>moi</i>.</p>
<p>It was a historic group, that meeting on the battle-field of Koloa
of the five principal sovereigns of the archipelago. Had Kukona been
ambitious the means were at his command to become the supreme head of
the island group; but he thought only of the future peace of Kauai, and
promptly dismissed from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href=
"#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>his mind all dreams of broader
fields of empire, well knowing that, were he able to seize the mastery
of the group, he could not hope to long maintain it.</p>
<p>Not a word of jeering or of triumph passed between Kalaunui and the
captive chiefs as they stood before Kukona, for the <i>aha alii</i> of
the period&mdash;the chiefs of accepted rank&mdash;commanded the
respect, not only of the untitled, but of each other, even in bondage
and in death. Kukona had met the <i>alii-nui</i> of Oahu in his own
dominions some years before, and recognized him at once, but the kings
of Maui and Molokai were strangers to him. Being informed of their rank
and the circumstances of their captivity, he ordered them to be
liberated at once, and with his own hands removed the cords from the
arms of his royal friend from Oahu.</p>
<p>The rescued princes were at once returned with befitting escorts to
their own possessions, but Kalaunui was retained as a prisoner of war.
But few of the invading army escaped. The victory was celebrated with
elaborate sacrifices and general rejoicing throughout the island. The
captured arms and canoes were divided among the assisting chiefs, and
peace reigned again on Kauai.</p>
<p>Kukona had secured the lasting friendship of the chiefs of Oahu,
Maui and Molokai, and therefore did not fear the retaliation of Hawaii.
But, as a guarantee of peace, he kept Kalaunui a prisoner, rightly
surmising that, if the ruling powers of Hawaii really valued the life
of the captive king, they would not imperil it by attempting his
release by force, and if they did not greatly value it he would be left
to his fate or the chances of peaceful negotiation.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Escaping from Koloa, Kualu and his companions made
sail for Hawaii, stopping for supplies at such intermediate points as
they deemed safe on the coasts of Oahu, Molokai and Maui, and on the
evening of the sixth day arrived at Waipio. They were the first to
bring to Hawaii the news of the defeat of Kalaunui on Kauai, and when
the people learned that the army had been destroyed the land was filled
with wailing.</p>
<p>Appearing at once before Kaheka and her son, Kualu recited to them
the story of the dreadful battle, but was unable <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>to
tell them definitely of the fate of Kalaunui. The grief of the queen
was great, and found strange and unreasonable expression in charging
Kualu with cowardice and ordering him from the palace. In vain he
protested against the ungenerous treatment. She had never liked him,
especially since discovering that he had secured something more than
the good-will of Kapapa, and it seemed monstrous to her that he should
have survived Kalaunui and the scores of gallant chiefs who fell with
him. She cruelly intimated that it was more than probable that, with
the force sent to protect the fleet, he had embarked in the canoes
without striking a blow, thus treacherously depriving the defeated army
of its sole means of escape.</p>
<p>Had these monstrous charges been made by a man Kualu would have
answered them with blows; but, as they were the foolish and
inconsiderate ravings of a woman, without venturing further reply he
took his leave, and with a heart filled with stifled rage and anguish
strode from the palace.</p>
<p>Proceeding up the valley, Kualu entered the hut of Waahia. He found
the <i>kaula</i> alone, as usual. She knew he was coming, but was none
the less rejoiced to meet him. With a word or two of greeting he sat
down in silence. The cruel words of Kaheka still stuck like thorns in
his throat. Waahia regarded him intently for a time, and then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it all. Kalaunui&rsquo;s army has been destroyed. You
escaped in a canoe with three others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Kalaunui?&rdquo; questioned Kualu, not a little amazed at
the correctness of her information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is a prisoner,&rdquo; replied the <i>kaula</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank the gods for that!&rdquo; exclaimed the chief
vehemently. &ldquo;He must be liberated, for he can tell her that in
escaping I acted neither with cowardice nor treachery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell whom?&rdquo; inquired the <i>kaula</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kaheka,&rdquo; answered Kualu. &ldquo;She charges me with
cowardice and desertion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Kaheka accuses you of what I know to be false!&rdquo;
said Waahia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned the chief; &ldquo;but the witnesses to
my fidelity are few and humble, and the words of the king can alone
relieve me in the eyes of the <i>aha alii</i> of the disgrace with
which the charges of Kaheka will cover me.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied the <i>kaula</i>, encouragingly;
&ldquo;but the disgrace will not be lasting, for the king will return
to do you justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will he return?&rdquo; eagerly inquired the chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; answered Waahia; &ldquo;but I know that
his rule is not yet at an end in Hawaii, and you must be
patient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Kualu promised to be patient, and for a few days bore the
neglect and frowns of his former friends, and the sneers and covert
insults of his enemies. But when the heartless accusations of Kaheka,
passing from tongue to tongue with the news of the dreadful slaughter,
became generally known, and almost as generally believed,
notwithstanding the statements of his three companions to the contrary,
Kualu&rsquo;s indignation could no longer be restrained, and he
challenged to combat and slew on the spot a chief who, in the presence
of a party of friends, repeated the charges to his face. Great
excitement followed, and in his desperation and wrath Kualu invited the
friends of his fallen defamer, one and all, to test his courage then or
thereafter.</p>
<p>As the life of Kualu was now in constant and undoubted peril, Waahia
advised him to leave Hawaii for a time, and together they set sail for
Molokai, and took up their residence at Kalaupapa. But before leaving
Waipio the <i>kaula</i> called upon the high-priest, by whom she was
held in great respect, and told him where she might be found on
Molokai, should her services be required.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they will be required,&rdquo; said Waahia, significantly.
&ldquo;Kalaunui is not dead, and when you shall have failed in all your
efforts to liberate him, tell Kaheka to think better of Kualu and send
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How know you that Kalaunui still lives?&rdquo; inquired the
priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should the high-priest of Pakaalani ask me that
question?&rdquo; replied Waahia. &ldquo;Where are his seers? Where are
the <i>kilos</i> of the temple, who in the heavens saw victory for
Kalaunui where I beheld defeat? Have they not been
consulted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All do not see with the eyes of Waahia,&rdquo; returned the
priest, evasively.</p>
<p>Flattered by this recognition of her superiority, the <i>kaula</i>
said, as she turned to depart: &ldquo;You will know more
to-morrow!&rdquo; And an hour after, accompanied by Kualu, she left
Waipio for Molokai.</p>
<p>The priest was not deceived by Waahia, for the day after
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>authentic intelligence was received from Maui to
the effect that Kalaunui&rsquo;s campaign had been a failure in Kauai,
and the king was a prisoner in the hands of Kukona. The leading chiefs
were called together in council, and several projects for the
liberation of the king were advanced and discussed. Kaheka was in favor
of raising a powerful army at once, and bringing her royal husband back
by force; but when it was considered by cooler heads that Kukona was
undoubtedly well prepared for war, and had secured the friendship, and
in an emergency could command the support, of the chiefs of Maui, Oahu
and Molokai, the suggestion was dismissed as dangerous and
impracticable.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances it was finally resolved to attempt the
liberation of Kalaunui through negotiation; and to this end messengers
were despatched to Kauai with offers of a large number of canoes,
spears and other war materials in exchange for the royal prisoner. But
the surrender of Kalaunui&rsquo;s fleet, and the capture of thousands
of spears and other arms, had given Kukona a great abundance of both,
and he declined the offer.</p>
<p>Failing in this, after a lapse of some months messengers were again
sent to Kukona with a proffer of twenty full-sized <i>mamos</i>, or
royal feather cloaks, a canoe-load of ivory and whalebone, and a
thousand stone <i>lipis</i>, or axes, of a superior kind peculiar to
Hawaii. The messengers were courteously received and listened to, but
the offer was not accepted.</p>
<p>War was again urged by Kaheka, but the chiefs refused to embark in
an undertaking so hazardous, and without their support she could do
nothing. And so for more than two years Kalaunui remained in captivity,
when a third attempt to ransom him was made. Kaheka despatched to Kauai
two ambassadors of high rank, offering her daughter Kapapa in marriage
either to Kukona or his son, Manokalanipo, and promising perpetual
peace between the islands. This offer was also declined, and Kukona
refused to name to the ambassadors the terms upon which he would treat
for the liberation of their king.</p>
<p>It now became a question either of war or the abandonment of
Kalaunui to his fate. In this dilemma the priests and <i>kaulas</i>
were consulted, but their predictions were vague and their counsels
unsatisfactory. Remembering the words of Waahia, the high-priest sought
the presence of Kaheka, and advised her to send for the old prophetess,
who was living with her foster-son at <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>Kalaupapa. This,
after some persuasion, she consented to do, and, despatching a chief of
high rank to Molokai, with the admission that she had accused Kualu
unjustly, the <i>kaula</i> was induced to return with the messenger to
Waipio. But Kualu did not accompany her. She was suspicious of Kaheka,
and advised him to remain at Kalaupapa.</p>
<p>Arriving at Waipio, the <i>kaula</i>, feeling that the game was now
in her own hands, informed the high-priest that she would communicate
with the leading chiefs of the kingdom convened in council. The chiefs
were accordingly assembled, and Waahia appeared before them. Kaheka was
present, as the <i>kaula</i> desired.</p>
<p>With a staff in her hand, capped with the head of an owl, and her
long, white hair falling to her waist, there was something weird and
awe-inspiring in the appearance of the venerable prophetess as she
entered the council-room and bowed low before Kaheka and the assembled
chiefs. It was not her privilege to break the silence without
permission, and when it had been formally accorded she raised her eyes,
and, without especially addressing any one, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have I been sent for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one could answer, not even Kaheka.</p>
<p>At length an old chief, after conferring with those around him,
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been sent for on the word of the high-priest, and
with the hope that you might be able to point out a way for the return
of Kalaunui to Hawaii. Can you do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can speak of no way,&rdquo; answered the <i>kaula</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can do nothing?&rdquo; returned the chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My words were that I could speak of no way, nor can I,&rdquo;
said the <i>kaula</i>; &ldquo;yet, keeping my own counsel, I might
possibly be able to accomplish what you all desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you undertake to do so?&rdquo; inquired Kaheka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, on one condition,&rdquo; was the prompt reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you ask for attempting to save the life of your
king?&rdquo; returned the queen, in a tone of rebuke.</p>
<p>Waahia did not like the spirit of the inquiry, and a scowl darkened
her wrinkled face as she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might ask that, if the gods willed that I should fail,
Kaheka would not charge me with treachery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reference to the treatment of Kualu created a feeling of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>uneasiness among the chiefs; but, without
inviting remark or explanation, the <i>kaula</i> continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I require is a pledge from every chief here that, should
I succeed in liberating Kalaunui, the terms of the release, whatever
they may be, will be complied with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chiefs hesitated, as it was not impossible that the sovereignty
of the island might be offered to Kukona by the prophetess, and they
could not pledge themselves to a sacrifice involving their own ruin.
Waahia relieved their apprehensions, however, by assuring them that the
pledge would not be considered binding if the terms affected either the
sovereignty of the island or the lives, possessions or prerogatives of
its chiefs. With this assurance the members of the council, after
briefly discussing the possibilities of the obligation, consented to
accept it. Thereupon the pledge was carefully repeated thrice by the
chiefs, and each in turn solemnly invoked upon himself, should he fail
to keep and observe it in its fulness, the wrath of <i>Hikapoloa</i>,
the divine trinity, and the swift and especial vengeance of
<i>Kuahana</i>, the slayer of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you satisfied now?&rdquo; inquired Kaheka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am satisfied,&rdquo; replied the <i>kaula</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you require assistance?&rdquo; This inquiry came from more
than one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only of the gods!&rdquo; was the impressive answer of Waahia,
as she left the council and slowly wended her way up the valley.</p>
<p>All night long strange lights flashed at intervals through the
weather-rent openings in the <i>kaula&rsquo;s</i> hut. Shadowy forms
were seen to move noiselessly around it; owls came and went as the
lights vanished and reappeared; and, just as the sun began to paint the
east, Waahia proceeded to the beach, and with a single sturdy assistant
of supernatural aspect embarked in a canoe which seemed to be equipped
and provisioned for a long voyage. This was the ghostly narration of
two or three of the nearest neighbors of the prophetess, and the truth
of the story was not doubted, even when it reached the palace.
Doubtless the plain facts were that Waahia spent the most of the night
in preparing for the voyage, and set sail early in the morning with an
assistant known to be trustworthy and familiar with the sea.</p>
<p>Waahia proceeded very leisurely to Kauai. The annual feast of
<i>Lono</i> was approaching, and as she desired to arrive there during
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>the festival, which would not be for some days,
she spent the intervening time in visiting many sacred spots and noted
temples on Maui, Oahu, Molokai and Lanai. Perhaps to commune with the
honored dead, she made a pilgrimage to the sacred valley of Iao, on the
island of Maui, where were buried many of the distinguished kings and
chiefs of the group. She stopped at Kalaupapa, on Molokai, to confer
with Kualu, and while there paid a visit to the home, near Kaluakoi, of
<i>Laamaomao</i>, the wind-god, who came from the south with Moikeha
more than a century before; and in the same valley visited the dreaded
spot where, in the reign of Kamauaua, the father of Kaupeepee, the
abductor of Hina, near the close of the eleventh century, sprang up in
a night the poisoned grove of <i>Kalaipahoa</i>, or, according to
another tradition, where that goddess, belonging to a family of
southern deities, visited the group with two of her sisters, and
entered and poisoned a small grove of trees of natural growth.</p>
<p>From one of these poisonous trees the famous idol of
<i>Kalaipahoa</i> was made. So poisonous was the wood that many died in
cutting down the tree and carving the image, for all perished whose
flesh was touched by the chips; but the workmen finally covered their
bodies with <i>kapa</i>, including masks for their faces and wraps for
their hands, and thus succeeded in completing the dangerous task
without farther loss of life. But a single image was made. It remained
with the ruling family of Molokai until the subjugation of the group by
Kamehameha I., when it came into his possession, and at his death, in
1819, was divided among a few of the principal chiefs. Two fragments of
the image, it is said, are still preserved, but they are carefully
guarded and never exhibited to eyes sceptical or profane. Long before
Waahia visited the spot the last vestige of the grove had disappeared,
but for many acres around where the terrible trees once stood the earth
was black and bare. Within the dreaded area no living thing was seen,
and birds fell dead in flying over it. But the <i>kaula</i> entered it
and returned unharmed, to the amazement of more than one witness.</p>
<p>Waahia next visited the <i>heiau</i> of Kaumolu, which was then a
<i>puhonua</i>, or place of refuge, and in another temple near the
coast offered sacrifices to the shark-god <i>Mooalii</i>. By reputation
she was generally known to the priesthood of the group, and was nowhere
regarded as an intruder in places sacred to worship. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span></p>
<p>Stopping at Ewa, on the island of Oahu, she saw for the first time
the hallowed enclosure of Kukaniloko, the creation of Nanakaoko, son of
Nanamaoa, the earliest arrival from the south of the migratory stream
of the eleventh century. Chiefs born there were endowed with especial
prerogatives and distinctions, and the beating of a sacred drum called
<i>hawea</i> gave notice without of the birth of a <i>tabu</i>
chief.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The winter solstice, which marked the end of the
Hawaiian year, was at hand, to be followed by the usual five
days&rsquo; feast of <i>Lono</i>, and Waahia so timed her voyage as to
arrive on Kauai the day before the festival began. She quietly landed
at Koloa, and as far as possible avoided observation by taking up her
residence in a small hut secured by her companion well back in the
neighboring hills.</p>
<p>These annual festivals of <i>Lono</i> were seasons of universal
merriment and rejoicing. The god was crowned and ornamented with
<i>leis</i> of flowers and feathers, and unstinted offerings of pigs,
fowls and fruits were laid upon the altars of the temples consecrated
to his worship. Chiefs and people alike gave themselves unreservedly
over to feasting, dancing, singing and the indulgence of almost every
appetite and caprice, and the Saturnalias of the old Romans gave to the
masses scarcely more license than the festivals of <i>Lono</i>. Every
instrument of music known to the people&mdash;and they possessed but
four or five of the simplest kinds&mdash;was brought into requisition,
and for five days there was almost an uninterrupted tumult of revelry.
<i>Lakakane</i>, the <i>hula</i> god, was decorated and brought out,
and every variety of the dance was given&mdash;some of them to the time
of vocal recitations and others to the noisier accompaniment of pipes,
drums and rattling calabashes. In the midst of these enjoyments
long-bearded bards appeared before the king and distinguished chiefs,
and while some of them recited wild historic tales of the past, others
chanted the <i>mele-inoas</i> and sang of the personal exploits of
their titled listeners. <i>Awa</i> and other intoxicating drinks were
freely indulged in by those who craved them, and the festivals were
usually followed by a week or more of general languor and
worthlessness.</p>
<p>It was the third day of the festival at Koloa. The gates of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>enclosure had been thrown open, and thousands of
people thronged around the royal mansion in a grove near which large
quantities of refreshments were spread on the ground in huge wooden
trays and calabashes. The feast was free to all, and Kukona lounged on
a pile of <i>kapa</i> in the deep shade of the trees in front of the
palace, happy in witnessing the enjoyment of his subjects. Around him
were standing a number of chiefs of high rank. A <i>kahili</i> of
bright feathers was occasionally and unobtrusively waved above his head
by the <i>paakahili</i>, and the <i>iwikuamoo</i>, <i>aipuupuu</i> and
other of his personal attendants, all of the lesser nobility, stood in
readiness to respond to his slightest wishes. A guard of inferior
chiefs kept the crowd from pressing too closely the distinguished
group, but from time to time, as permission was granted, select bands
of dancers and musicians and chanters of ability were allowed to
approach and entertain the royal party with specimens of their skill
and erudition.</p>
<p>A company of dancers had just retired, when Waahia, with a staff in
her hand, and wearing a short mantle, indicating that she claimed
privileges of dress which were not accorded to women generally, asked
permission to be admitted to the presence of the king. Her strange
appearance excited the curiosity of Kukona, and she was allowed to
approach. Kneeling and touching her forehead to the ground, she rose
and asked if it was the pleasure of the king to hear her. As these
ceremonies, due to supreme authority, were usually waived on such
occasions, it was surmised that the woman must be a stranger in Kauai.
She was told to speak. A <i>moooelo</i>, or historic chant, was
expected; but in a full, sharp voice she chanted these words:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;O the long knife of the stranger,</p>
<p class="line">Of the stranger from other lands,</p>
<p class="line">Of the stranger with sparkling eyes,</p>
<p class="line">Of the stranger with a white face!</p>
<p class="line">O long knife of <i>Lono</i>, the gift of
<i>Lono</i>;</p>
<p class="line">It flashes like fire in the sun;</p>
<p class="line">Its edge is sharper than stone,</p>

<p class="line">O long knife of the stranger,</p>
<p class="line">O bright knife of <i>Lono</i>,</p>
<p class="line">It is lost, it is lost, it is lost!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">At the conclusion of the chant, which was listened to
with attention, the <i>kaula</i> bowed and disappeared in the crowd.
Kukona had heard of the long knife, and Waahia&rsquo;s description of
its powers interested him greatly. He despatched a messenger to the
high-priest, ordering that the diviners at once be put to the task of
discovering the hiding-place of the sacred weapon.</p>
<p>On the following afternoon Waahia appeared before the king and his
chiefs, and with the same ceremonies repeated her chant of the day
before. The high-priest was summoned, and informed the king that his
diviners had as yet discovered no trace of the long knife.</p>
<p>The third day Waahia appeared and repeated her chant before the
king, and silently withdrew, as before. Again the high-priest was
summoned, but was able to offer no assurance that the long knife would
be found by the <i>kahunas</i>. They had resorted to every means of
inspiration and magic known to them, but could discover no clue to the
mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this woman who for three successive days has told us
of the lost knife?&rdquo; inquired Kukona, addressing the chiefs
surrounding him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203"
name="pb203">203</a>]</span></p>
<p>No one seemed to be able to answer. Finally the master of ceremonies
stepped forward and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman, I think, is Waahia, the noted prophetess of
Hawaii. I saw her fifteen years ago in Waipio, and am quite sure that I
remember her face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name, if not the face, of the distinguished seeress was known to
the king and many others present, and the high-priest, anxious to
explain the failure of his magicians, bowed and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The master of ceremonies has doubtless spoken truly. The
woman must be Waahia. Her powers are great, and a secret in her keeping
is beyond the reach of the <i>kaulas</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accepting this explanation of the high-priest, Kukona ordered the
prophetess to be found and respectfully conducted to the royal mansion;
but after a fruitless search of two days it was reported that she had
probably left the valley, and therefore could not be found.</p>
<p>Irritated at what seemed to be the inefficiency or neglect of his
<i>kaulas</i> and chiefs, Kukona was about to attach a death-penalty to
further failure when Waahia suddenly entered the royal enclosure and
approached the palace. Her appearance was most welcome to the attending
chiefs, and she was ushered at once into the presence of the king. So
delighted was Kukona at the unexpected visit that he rose unconsciously
to his feet and greeted the prophetess. This breach of courtly form
amazed the attendants of the king, and suggested to them that the
strange visitor must be of supreme rank; but before any explanation
could be gathered they were ordered to retire, even to the
<i>paakahili</i>, and Kukona was left alone with the <i>kaula</i>.</p>
<p>The king motioned his visitor to a lounge of <i>kapa</i>, for she
seemed to be old and feeble, and he had a favor to ask. Seating
herself, as requested, the king approached, and, in a voice that could
not well be overheard, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you Waahia, the prophetess of Hawaii?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Waahia,&rdquo; answered the <i>kaula</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have chanted of the long knife of the stranger, of the
bright knife of <i>Lono</i>, of the lost knife of Wailuku,&rdquo;
resumed Kukona. &ldquo;Our diviners can give me no information
concerning it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waahia smiled significantly, but made no reply, and the king
continued: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;They say you have <i>tabued</i> the secret, and others,
therefore, cannot share it. Is it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; was the brief reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can find the sacred knife?&rdquo; eagerly suggested
Kukona.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can find it,&rdquo; was the <i>kaula&rsquo;s</i> emphatic
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then find and bring it to Kukona, and for the service claim
what you will,&rdquo; was the prompt proposal of the king.</p>
<p>With the way thus broadly opened, Waahia announced that the price of
the knife must be the liberation of Kalaunui, and was astonished at the
promptness with which the terms were accepted. It was manifest to
Waahia that he either placed a very high value upon the talisman, or
had kept his royal prisoner about as long as he cared to detain him or
the peace of his kingdom required. In either event his unhesitating
acceptance of the main consideration warranted Waahia in at once naming
one or two other conditions, which were just as promptly agreed to by
the king. One of these conditions was that Kalaunui should agree, as
the only consideration for his release to be known to him, that his
daughter Kapapa should be given in marriage to the chief Kualu, not
only as a fitting union, but as a measure of atonement for the unjust
and disgraceful charges made against that worthy young chief by Kaheka,
and that Kukona and Kalaunui should mutually pledge themselves to the
fulfilment of the compact. The other condition was that, on the
delivery of the knife to Kukona, he was to release the captive king at
once, and return him to Hawaii in company with three high chiefs of
Kauai, who were to remain in Waipio until after the consummation of the
marriage of Kapapa and Kualu.</p>
<p>Kalaunui was communicated with. For nearly three years he had been
confined and closely but respectfully guarded within a square of high
stone walls enclosing a single hut. Utterly unable to account for
Kukona&rsquo;s interest in Kualu, he nevertheless accepted the terms
submitted to him for his release, and Waahia started at once for
Kalaupapa, promising to be back within six days. For the voyage she
accepted a canoe larger and more commodious than her own, and the
services of five additional rowers.</p>
<p>Arriving at Kalaupapa on the morning of the third day from Koloa,
Waahia startled Kualu by informing him that Kalaunui <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>was
about to be released, and that in twelve days he must return without
further notice to Waipio, where he would be relieved of all disgrace by
the king, and become the husband of Kapapa. Coming from Waahia, he
believed the words as if they had been flashed from the heavens, and
asked for no confirmation as the <i>kaula</i> abruptly left him and
proceeded alone toward the hills.</p>
<p>A few hours later Waahia re-embarked for Kauai, taking with her,
securely wrapped in a number of <i>kapa</i> folds, the sword of
Kaluiki. She reached Koloa within the time promised, and, proceeding to
the palace, delivered to the king, in person and alone, the glittering
blade which rumor had clothed with extraordinary sanctity and
power.</p>
<p>Kalaunui renewed his pledge to Kukona, and the next morning embarked
for Hawaii in a large double canoe, accompanied by three of the leading
chiefs of Kauai and their attendants. Stepping into the <i>kaulua</i>
as it was about to be shoved into the surf, Kalaunui caught sight of
Waahia, for the first time for years, as she stood leaning upon her
staff near the water. Kualu&rsquo;s part in the agreement with Kukona
was explained at once by Waahia&rsquo;s presence in Koloa; but what was
Kualu to Kukona? and, if nothing, what influences had the <i>kaula</i>
been able to bring to effect his release upon such conditions? No
matter. Kalaunui was too happy in his liberation to quarrel with the
means through which it had been secured, and he turned with a look of
gratitude toward the prophetess as the canoe shot out into the
breakers.</p>
<p>The return of their captive king was joyously celebrated by the
people of Hawaii, and a few days after Kapapa became the willing wife
of Kualu. The union was distasteful to Kaheka, but she was powerless to
prevent it. The agreement was faithfully fulfilled by Kalaunui, and he
spent the remainder of his days in peace, leaving the kingdom to his
only son, Kuaiwa, between whom and Kualu a lasting friendship was
established.</p>
<p>Kualu, with Kapapa, became the head of an influential family, one of
his direct descendants having been the wife of Makaoku, a son of Kiha
and brother of Liloa, one of the most noted of the kings of Hawaii.</p>
<p>The sword of Kaluiki, the ransom of a king, remained for some
generations with the descendants of Kukona; but what became of it in
the end tradition fails to tell. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207"

<h3 class="main">I.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Kaululaau was one of the sons of Kakaalaneo, brother
of, and joint ruler with, Kakae in the government of Maui. The latter
was the legitimate heir to the <i>moiship</i>, but, as he was
weak-minded, Kakaalaneo ruled jointly with him and was the real
sovereign of the little kingdom. The court of the brothers was at Lele
(now Lahaina), and was one of the most distinguished in the group.</p>
<p>The mother of Kaululaau was Kanikaniaula, of the family of Kamauaua,
king of Molokai, through his son Haili, who was the brother or
half-brother of Keoloewa and Kaupeepee. The latter, it will be
remembered, was the abductor of the celebrated Hina, of Hawaii, and the
family was of the old strain of Maweke.</p>
<p>Kaululaau was probably born somewhere between the years 1390 and
1400. He had a half-sister, whose name was Wao, and a half-brother,
Kaihiwalua, who was the father of Luaia, who became the husband of a
daughter of Piliwale, <i>moi</i> of Oahu, and brother of Lo-Lale. He
doubtless had other brothers and sisters, since his father was blessed
with two or more wives, but the legends fail to refer to them.</p>
<p>Kahekili, son of Kakae, and who became his successor in the
<i>moiship</i>, was of near the age of his cousin, Kaululaau, and the
two princes grew to manhood together. They were instructed by the same
teachers, schooled in the same arts and chiefly accomplishments, and
chanted the same genealogical <i>meles</i>. Yet in disposition and
personal appearance they were widely different.</p>
<p>From his youth Kahekili was staid, sober and thoughtful. Bred to the
knowledge that he would succeed his father as <i>moi</i> of the island,
he began early in life to prepare himself for the proper exercise of
supreme authority, and at the age of twenty was noted for his
intelligence, dignity and royal bearing. He had been told by a prophet
that one of his name would be the last independent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>king
of Maui, and the information rendered him solicitous for his future and
drove many a smile from his lips. Yet, with all his austerity and
circumspection, he was kind-hearted and affectionate, and his pastimes
were such as comported with his dignity. In height he was somewhat
below the chiefly medium, and his features were rugged and of a Papuan
cast; but all knew that he was royal in heart and thought, and the
respect due to him was not withheld.</p>
<p>Kaululaau was unlike his royal cousin in almost every respect. He
was noted alike for his intelligence, his manly beauty and his
rollicking spirit of mischief and merriment. He did not covet the
sceptre. He thought more of a wild debauch, with music, dancing and a
calabash of <i>awa</i>, than the right to command
&ldquo;downward&rdquo; or &ldquo;upward the face&rdquo;; and since
Kahekili was the designated successor of his father, he claimed the
right, as a favored and <i>tabu</i> subject of the realm, to enjoy
himself in such manner as best accorded with his tastes. As he could
not make laws, he found a pleasure in breaking them. He was neither
wantonly cruel nor malignant, but recklessly wild and mischievous, and
neither the reproofs of his father nor the mild persuasions of his
cousin were sufficient to restrain him. His bantering reply to the
latter was: &ldquo;When you become king I will act with more propriety.
Two <i>mois</i> can afford one wild prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had a congenial following of companions and retainers, who
assisted him in his schemes of mischief. With feasting and <i>hula</i>
dancing he would keep the village in an uproar for a dozen consecutive
nights. He would send canoes adrift, open the gates of fish-ponds,
remove the supports of houses, and paint swine black to deceive the
sacrificial priests. He devised an instrument to imitate the
death-warning notes of the <i>alae</i>, and frightened people by
sounding it near their doors; and to others he caused information to be
conveyed that they were being prayed to death.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these misdemeanors, Kaululaau was popular with the
people, since the chiefs or members of the royal household were usually
the victims of his mischievous freaks. He was encouraged in his
disposition to qualify himself for the priesthood, under the
instruction of the eminent high-priest and prophet, Waolani, and had
made substantial advances in the calling, when he was banished to the
island of Lanai by his royal father for an offence which could neither
be overlooked nor forgiven. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href=
"#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span></p>
<p>At that time Lanai was infested with a number of gnomes, monsters
and evil spirits, among them the gigantic <i>moo</i>, Mooaleo. They
ravaged fields, uprooted cocoanut-trees, destroyed the walls of
fish-ponds, and otherwise frightened and discomfited the inhabitants of
the island. That his residence there might be made endurable, Kaululaau
was instructed by the <i>kaulas</i> and sorcerers of the court in many
charms, spells, prayers and incantations with which to resist the
powers of the supernatural monsters. When informed of these exorcising
agencies by Kaululaau, his friend, the venerable high-priest, Waolani,
told him that they would avail him nothing against the more powerful
and malignant of the demons of Lanai.</p>
<p>Disheartened at the declaration, Kaululaau was about to leave the
<i>heiau</i> to embark for Lanai, when Waolani, after some hesitation,
stayed his departure, and, entering the inner temple, soon returned
with a small roll of <i>kapa</i> in his hand. Slowly uncording and
removing many folds of cloth, an ivory spear-point a span in length was
finally brought to view. Holding it before the prince, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this. It will serve you in any way you may require. Its
powers are greater than those of any god inhabiting the earth. It has
been dipped in the waters of <i>Po</i>, and many generations ago was
left by Lono upon one of his altars for the protection of a temple
menaced by a mighty fish-god who found a retreat beneath it in a great
cavern connected with the sea. Draw a line with it and nothing can pass
the mark. Affix it to a spear and throw it, and it will reach the
object, no matter how far distant. Much more will it do, but let what I
have said suffice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince eagerly reached to possess the treasure, but the priest
withdrew it and continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give it to you on condition that it pass from you to no
other hands than mine, and that if I am no longer living when you
return to Maui&mdash;as you some day will&mdash;you will secretly
deposit it with my bones. Swear to this in the name of Lono.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kaululaau solemnly pronounced the required oath. The priest then
handed him the talisman, wrapped in the <i>kapa</i> from which it had
been taken, and he left the temple, and immediately embarked with a
number of his attendants for Lanai.</p>
<p>Reaching Lanai, he established his household on the south side of
the island. Learning his name and rank, the people <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>treated him with great respect&mdash;for Lanai
was then a dependency of Maui&mdash;assisted in the construction of the
houses necessary for his accommodation, and provided him with fish,
<i>poi</i>, fruits and potatoes in great abundance. In return for this
devotion he set about ridding the island of the supernatural pests with
which it had been for years afflicted.</p>
<p>In the legend of &ldquo;Kelea, the Surf-rider of Maui,&rdquo; will
be found some reference to the battles of Kaululaau with the evil
spirits and monsters of Lanai. His most stubborn conflict was with the
gnome god Mooaleo. He imprisoned the demon within the earth by drawing
a line around him with the sacred spear-point, and subsequently
released and drove him into the sea.</p>
<p>More than a year was spent by Kaululaau in quieting and expelling
from the island the malicious monsters that troubled it, but he
succeeded in the end in completely relieving the people from their
vexatious visitations. This added immeasurably to his popularity, and
the choicest of the products of land and sea were laid at his feet.</p>
<p>His triumph over the demons of Lanai was soon known on the other
islands of the group, and when it reached the ears of Kakaalaneo he
despatched a messenger to his son, offering his forgiveness and
recalling him from exile. The service he had rendered was important,
and his royal father was anxious to recognize it by restoring him to
favor.</p>
<p>But Kaululaau showed no haste in availing himself of his
father&rsquo;s magnanimity. Far from the restraints of the court, he
had become attached to the independent life he had found in exile, and
could think of no comforts or enjoyments unattainable on Lanai. The
women there were as handsome as elsewhere, the bananas were as sweet,
the cocoanuts were as large, the <i>awa</i> was as stimulating, and the
fisheries were as varied and abundant in product. He had congenial
companionship, and bands of musicians and dancers at his call. The best
of the earth and the love of the people were his, and the
<i>apapani</i> sang in the grove that shaded his door. What more could
he ask, what more expect should he return to Maui? His exile had ceased
to be a punishment, and his father&rsquo;s message of recall was
scarcely deemed a favor.</p>
<p>However, Kaululaau returned a respectful answer by his
father&rsquo;s messenger, thanking Kakaalaneo for his clemency, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>announcing that he would return to Maui some
time in the near future, after having visited some of the other islands
of the group; and three months later he began to prepare for a trip to
Hawaii. He procured a large double canoe, which he painted a royal
yellow, and had fabricated a number of cloaks and capes of the feathers
of the <i>oo</i> and <i>mamo</i>. At the prow of his canoe he mounted a
carved image of Lono, and at the top of one of the masts a place was
reserved for the proud <i>tabu</i> standard of an <i>aha alii</i>. This
done, with a proper retinue he set sail for Hawaii.</p>
</div>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">II.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On his visit to Hawaii, Kaululaau was accompanied by a
number of companions of his own disposition and temperament. Among them
was Kamakaua, a young Maui chief, who had followed him into exile and
was thoroughly devoted to his interests. He was brave, courtly and
intelligent, and in personal appearance somewhat resembled the prince.
The crew and most of the attendants of the prince had been selected by
Kamakaua, including the chief navigator and astrologer; and however
competent they may have been in their respective stations, it was
discovered during the voyage that they were no less efficient as
musicians and dancers. Hence there was no lack of amusement as the huge
double canoe breasted the waves of Alenuihaha Channel, and on the
morning of the third day stood off the village of Waipio, in the
district of Hamakua, Hawaii.</p>
<p>At that time Kauholanui-mahu, father of the noted Kiha, was king of
Hawaii. His wife was Neula, a chiefess of Maui, who had inherited very
considerable possessions in the neighborhood of Honuaula, on that
island. As the climate of the locality was salubrious, and the
neighboring waters abounded abundantly in fish, the royal couple made
frequent and sometimes lengthy visits thither. These visits were
usually made without the knowledge of Kakaalaneo, and the unexplained
attachment of the Hawaiian king to the comparatively small inheritance
of his wife on a neighboring island began to be regarded with
suspicion, and had become a theme for speculation and inquiry at the
court of Lahaina.</p>
<p>At the time of the visit of Kaululaau to Waipio, Kauholanui
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>had been absent for some months on Maui, leaving
Neula in charge of the government of Hawaii. Attributing the absence of
the king to deliberate neglect, Neula had become greatly dissatisfied,
and whispers of coming trouble were rife throughout the island. All
this was doubtless known to Kaululaau, and, as the royal residence was
at Waipio, it was upon the beach below it that he landed with his party
and drew up his double canoe.</p>
<p>The presence and state of the strangers were soon heralded to the
queen, and she promptly despatched messengers, courteously inviting the
prince and his personal retainers to become her guests at the royal
<i>hale</i>, at the same time giving orders for the accommodation of
the humbler of his attendants and followers, as was the hospitable
custom of the time.</p>
<p>Accepting the invitation, Kaululaau and four of his chiefly
companions were provided with quarters within the palace enclosure, and
their food was served from the royal table. In the afternoon Kaululaau
was accorded an audience with the queen, during which he presented his
friends, including Kamakaua.</p>
<p>The prince whiled away nearly a month at Waipio, and many formal
entertainments were given in his honor. Neula was unusually agreeable,
and was soon on terms of friendly intimacy both with the prince and
Kamakaua. This was exactly what Kaululaau desired, since it enabled him
to devise and assist in the execution of a scheme for bringing the king
back from Maui and keeping him thereafter within his own kingdom.</p>
<p>Under the instructions of Kaululaau, Kamakaua assumed to be greatly
smitten with the charms of the queen. As she was a comely woman, and
somewhat vain of her personal appearance, the conquest of the handsome
chief gratified her; but his attentions developed the fact that he had
a rival in Noakua, a chief of Kohala. This discovery simplified the
plans of the prince, and relieved Kamakaua of a dangerous duty in the
end. In pressing his suit he found a pretext for informing the queen
that the continued absence of the king was due to the fact that he had
taken another wife, with whom he was living at Honuaula, and that he
had ceased to care either for his kingdom or his family.</p>
<p>While Kamakaua was pouring this poison into the ears of Neula,
Kaululaau, who had made the acquaintance of Noakua, was planting in the
mind of that chief the seeds of sedition. He flattered him with the
opinion that he was made to rule, and by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>degrees developed to
him a plan through which, with the favor of the queen, he could seize
the government, unite the principal chiefs in his support, and prevent
Kauholanui from returning to Hawaii.</p>
<p>The ambition of Noakua, and anger of the queen at the presumed
neglect and infidelity of her husband, soon harmonized them in a plot
against the absent king. Preparations for the revolt began to be
observed, when Kaululaau, not wishing to be openly identified with the
dangerous movement, quietly embarked with his party for Hilo, where he
remained to watch the progress of the struggle which he had been
instrumental in originating.</p>
<p>The prince had been in Hilo but a few days when a <i>lunapai</i>
arrived from Waipio, summoning the chief of the district to repair
thither with eight hundred warriors, and announcing the assumption of
the sovereignty of the island by Neula. Similar notifications were sent
to the chiefs of the other districts of the kingdom, and soon all was
excitement from Kau to Kohala.</p>
<p>Hearing of the revolt, Kauholanui, who had been engaged in
constructing a fish-pond at Keoneoio, in the neighborhood of Honuaula,
left Maui at once with less than a hundred spears, and, landing in
Kona, whose chief could be relied upon, he started overland for Waipio.
The revolution was unpopular, and with great unanimity the chiefs and
people rallied to the standard of the king. The struggle was brief. A
battle was fought near Waimea, resulting in the defeat of the rebel
army and the death of Noakua.</p>
<p>This ended the revolt. As a punishment to Neula the king took
another wife. But the object of Kaululaau was accomplished, for
Kauholanui never again visited Maui, although the queen spent much of
her time thereafter at Honuaula, where her favorite guest and friend
was Kamakaua.</p>
<p>Leaving Hilo, Kaululaau and his party leisurely drifted along the
coasts of Puna until they reached the borders of Kau, when they landed
at Keauhou to spend a few days in fishing and surf-riding.</p>
<p>Weary of the sport, Kaululaau left the bathers in the surf, one
afternoon, and threw himself under the shade of a <i>hala</i> tree near
the shore. Watching the clouds and the sea-birds circling in the
heavens above him, he fell asleep, and when he awoke his eyes fell upon
a beautiful woman sitting upon a rock not more than a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>hundred paces distant, and silently watching the
swimmers as they came riding in on the crests of the rollers. Her
skirts were a <i>pau</i> spangled with crystals, and over her shoulders
hung a short mantle of the colors of a rainbow. Her long hair was held
back by a <i>lei</i> of flowers, and her wrists and ankles were adorned
with circlets of tiny shells of pink and white.</p>
<p>The appearance of the woman dazzled him, and after gazing for some
time, and rubbing his eyes to be sure that he was not dreaming, he rose
to his feet and approached the radiant being. Advancing within four or
five paces of the woman, apparently unobserved, he stopped, and with a
cough attracted her attention. Turning her face toward him, he greeted
her courteously, and requested permission to approach nearer and
converse with her. Her appearance indicated that she was a person of
rank, and he did not feel like trespassing uninvited upon her privacy.
She did not deign to make any reply to his request, but, after scanning
him from head to foot, turned her face toward the sea again with a
contemptuous toss of the head.</p>
<p>He hesitated for a moment, and then turned and strode rapidly down
to the beach, where his double canoe had been safely drawn up on the
sands. &ldquo;In the guise of a bather,&rdquo; thought the prince,
&ldquo;she evidently mistakes me for a servant. I will approach her in
the garb to which my rank entitles me, and see what effect that will
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Entering the canoe, he girded his loins with a gaudy <i>maro</i>,
hung round his neck a <i>palaoa</i>, and threw over his shoulders a
royal mantle of yellow feathers. Then, crowning his head with a
brilliant feather helmet, he selected a spear of the length of six
paces and stepped from the canoe. As he did so he stumbled. &ldquo;This
means that I have forgotten or omitted something of importance,&rdquo;
said the prince to himself, stopping and in detail scanning his
equipments. At that moment a lizard ran across his path and entered a
hole in the earth. This brought to mind his battle with the gigantic
gnome on Lanai, and with a smile he re-entered the canoe. Taking from a
calabash, where it had been for months secreted, the charmed
spear-point of Lono, he affixed it firmly to the point of a javelin,
and, thus equipped, again sought the presence of the fascinating being
by whom he had been repulsed.</p>
<p>Advancing as before, he once more craved permission to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>approach near enough to drink in the beauty of
her eyes. But she seemed to be in no mood to consent. Scanning him in
his changed apparel, with an air of indifference she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not have taken the trouble to bedeck yourself with
royal feathers. I knew you before, as I know you now, to be Kaululaau,
son of Kakaalaneo, <i>moi</i> of Maui. I do not desire your
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you know who I am, I must claim the right to insist
upon my request, unless you can show, indeed, that you are of equal or
better rank.&rdquo; Saying this, the prince took a step forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come,&rdquo; replied the woman, &ldquo;since you are
rude enough to attempt it. Sit at my feet and tell me of your love, and
I will search the caves for squid and beat the <i>kapa</i> for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince advanced joyfully, and was about to seat himself at the
feet of the lovely being, when with a cry of pain he sprang back. The
rock he had touched was as hot as if it had just been thrown from the
crater of a volcano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the woman tauntingly; &ldquo;do you not see
that I am waiting for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the prince advanced, but the earth for two or three paces
around her was glimmering with heat, and he hastily withdrew to where
the ground and rocks were cool. He was now satisfied that he was
dealing with some one wielding supernatural powers, and resolved to
test the efficacy of the charmed point of his javelin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you not come?&rdquo; continued the woman in a tone of
mingled defiance and reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the earth where you are sitting is too warm for my
feet,&rdquo; replied the prince, innocently. &ldquo;Come where I am
standing, and I will sit beside you.&rdquo; And with the point of his
javelin he marked upon the ground the boundaries of a space around
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Retire some paces, and I will do so,&rdquo; replied the
woman, confidently. The prince withdrew, as requested, and she quietly
removed to the spot where he had been standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now come,&rdquo; said the woman, reseating herself;
&ldquo;perhaps you will find it cooler here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; returned the prince, as he began cautiously
to advance. He crossed the line marked by the point of his javelin,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>and felt no heat. He took three more steps
forward, and the earth was still cool. Another step, which brought him
within two paces of the enchantress, convinced him that her powers were
impotent within the boundaries of the line he had drawn, and with a
sudden leap forward he caught her in his arms.</p>
<p>Astounded at the failure of her powers, and humiliated at her
defeat, the woman struggled to free herself from the embrace of the
prince; but within the charmed circle she possessed but the strength of
a simple woman, and was compelled to yield to the supreme indignities
of superior force.</p>
<p>Exasperated beyond measure, she at length succeeded in eluding his
grasp and springing beyond the fatal line. The prince followed, but she
was now herself, and he could neither overtake nor restrain her.
Retreating some distance up the hill, she suddenly stopped and awaited
his approach. She permitted him to advance within forty or fifty paces
of her, when in the space of a breath she abandoned her captivating
disguise and stood forth in the form of Pele, the dreadful goddess of
Kilauea. Her eyes were bright as the midday sun, and her hair was like
a flame of fire.</p>
<p>The prince stopped in dismay. The goddess raised her hand, and at
her feet burst forth a stream of molten lava, rolling fiercely down
upon the prince, as if to engulf him. He started to escape by flight,
but the stream widened and increased in speed as it followed. Fearful
that it would overtake him before he could reach the sea, he thought of
his javelin, and with the point hastily drew a line in front of the
advancing flood. Continuing his flight and looking back, he discovered,
to his great relief, that the stream had stopped abruptly at the line
he had drawn, and could not pass it. Passing into a ravine, the angry
flow sought to reach the sea through its channel, and thus cut off the
retreat of the prince; but he crossed the depression, marking a line as
he went, and the fiery avalanche was stayed at the limit.</p>
<p>Observing that she was thwarted by some power whose element seemed
to be of the earth, Pele summoned her brother Keuakepo from Kilauea,
and a shower of fire and ashes descended upon Kaululaau and his
companions. Leaping into the sea to avoid the fire, they dragged the
double canoe from its moorings, and, swimming and pushing it through
the breakers, escaped from the coast with but little injury.

<h3 class="main">III.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Having embroiled himself with the divine and political
powers of Hawaii, Kaululaau rounded the southern point of La Lae and
set sail for Molokai. He spent a month on that island with the royal
relatives of his mother, by whom he was appropriately received and
entertained. He visited the home of Laamaomao, the wind-god, the
poisoned grove of Kalaipahoa, and the demolished fortress on the
promontory of Haupu, where the gallant Kaupeepee, of whose blood he
was, met his dramatic death. He then set sail for Oahu.</p>
<p>The island of Oahu was at that period one of the most prosperous in
the group. It was under the government of Kalona-iki, one of the two
sons of Mailikukahi, who during his reign had instituted a code of laws
giving better protection to the poor, making theft punishable with
death, and claiming as the wards of the government the first-born male
children of all families, without regard to rank or condition.</p>
<p>Kalona continued the peaceful and intelligent policy of his father,
and his court was noted alike for the brilliancy of its chiefs and the
beauty of its women. His principal place of residence was Waikiki,
although he had sumptuous temporary resorts at Ewa and Waialua.</p>
<p>Kaululaau first touched at Waialua, but, learning that the king was
at Waikiki, he ordered his canoe to proceed around to the south side of
the island in charge of his chief navigator, while he and Kamakaua
concluded to make the journey overland. Dispensing with all insignia of
rank, and habited like simple commoners, the prince and his companion
started unattended for Waikiki. Both were armed with javelins, but the
one borne by Kaululaau was tipped with the charmed point of Lono.</p>
<p>Proceeding along the foot of the Kaala range of mountains, in the
afternoon they sat down to rest in the shade of a <i>hala</i> tree. In
a ravine below them five or six men were working, and scattered along
its banks were a number of huts. Soon a tumult of screams reached them,
and men, women and children were seen running hither and thither in a
state of great excitement.</p>
<p>The travelers sprang to their feet, and as they did so a gigantic
bird swept immediately over their heads and winged its way <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>toward the hills. It passed so closely that the
branches of the <i>hala</i> tree were swayed by the motion of its
mighty pinions, and its outspread wings seemed to measure scarcely less
than twenty long steps from tip to tip.</p>
<p>While watching the monster with amazement, a woman approached, and
to the questions of the prince replied, between wails of anguish, that
the great bird&mdash;the <i>Pueoalii</i>, as she called it&mdash;had
just killed her only child in front of her hut, with a stab to the
heart resembling the cut of a knife. She hurriedly gave the additional
information that for many years past the same bird had at intervals
visited different districts of the island, killing children, pigs and
fowls, and that the priests had declared it to be a <i>pueo</i>, or
owl, sacred to the gods, and which could not, therefore, be molested
with safety, even if harm to it were possible from human hands.</p>
<p>Better learned in the inspiration and purposes of such
visitations&mdash;since he had been instructed by the eminent
high-priest Waolani&mdash;and having had many conflicts with malignant
spirits, he doubted that the monster he had just seen was of the sacred
<i>pueo</i> family, and requested that he be shown the dead child.
Proceeding to the hut and inspecting the wound, he observed that the
fatal cut was upward, and not downward, as it would have been had it
been made by the beak of an owl. This confirmed him in the correctness
of his first impression, and, requesting Kamakaua to follow him, he
started toward the hills in the direction taken by the bird.</p>
<p>They could still see it in the distance, like a dark cloud against
the mountain. After following it for some time the bird swooped down to
commit some fresh depredation, and then rose and alighted upon a rocky
ridge with precipitous face sweeping down from the main summit of
Kaala.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why go farther?&rdquo; said Kamakaua. &ldquo;We cannot reach
the bird, and, if we could, our spears would be like straws to such a
monster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if by a strong hand, the javelin in the grasp of the prince
forcibly turned and pointed toward the bird. Smiling at the augury,
Kaululaau replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look you carefully back and see if we are
followed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kamakaua turned his face in compliance, and as he did so the prince
poised his javelin and hurled it in the direction of the bird.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>In twenty paces the point did not droop; in
forty it did not fall to the ground; in a hundred a new energy seized
it, and like a flash of light it sped out of sight. A moment later the
prince saw the bird sink and disappear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see no one,&rdquo; said Kamakaua, after carefully
scanning the ground over which they had passed. &ldquo;Nor can I now
see the bird,&rdquo; he continued, looking toward the ridge.
&ldquo;Where can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the foot of the cliff,&rdquo; replied the prince,
&ldquo;with the point of my javelin in his heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having been with the prince on Molokai, Kamakaua received the
strange information without question or great wonder, and, hastening to
the base of the precipice, they found the monster dead, with the
javelin buried in its breast. Removing the weapon, they cut off the
head and one of the feet of the bird, pulled from its wings four of the
longest feathers, and with them returned to the <i>hala</i> tree under
which they had found shelter from the sun. The burden taxed their
strength to the utmost. The weight of the head, which was borne by the
prince, was scarcely less than that of his own body, while the feathers
were seven paces in length, and the claws two paces between their
extreme points.</p>
<p>Great excitement followed the spreading of the news that
<i>Pueoalii</i> had been killed by strangers. The sufferers through its
visitations were disposed to commend the act, and others condemned it
as an insult to the gods, which would probably bring broadcast calamity
upon the whole island. To placate the anger of the gods it was proposed
to sacrifice the strangers at the nearest <i>heiau</i>, and,
respectfully wrapping the head of the bird in <i>kapa</i>, Kaululaau
and his companion were conducted with their trophies to the sacred
temple of Kukaniloko, which was not far distant. They were accompanied
by a crowd which constantly swelled in numbers as they proceeded, and
on arriving at the <i>heiau</i> they were surrounded by four or five
hundred men and women, many of them armed and clamoring for their
blood.</p>
<p>Kaululaau was in nowise alarmed, but rather enjoyed the situation.
The high-priest of the temple appeared and the matter was laid before
him. Looking at the foot and mighty feathers of the bird, he turned to
the strangers and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have slain a creature sacred to the gods, and my thought
is that you should be sacrificed to avert their wrath.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful in your judgment, priest,&rdquo; replied the
prince. &ldquo;How know you that the bird was sacred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For years it has been so regarded,&rdquo; returned the
priest. &ldquo;How know you that it was not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it become the high-priest of Kukaniloko to ask such a
question?&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;But I will reply to it when
you answer this: With the javelin now in my hand I killed the bird at a
distance farther than from where we stand to yonder hills. Could it
have been done by human hand without the especial favor of the gods. If
not, then how have the gods been angered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest was confounded, and when the prince proposed to submit
the question of his guilt to the king, the suggestion was accepted. It
now being near nightfall, Kaululaau and his companion were removed
within the enclosure of the temple for safe-keeping, and, knowing that
they would be deprived of their weapons, the prince removed the charmed
point from his javelin and secreted it in the folds of his
<i>maro</i>.</p>
<p>Early next morning the high-priest and his two prisoners, who were
kept under no marked restraint, accompanied by a large concourse of
people carrying the head, foot and feathers of <i>Pueoalii</i>, started
for Waikiki. Every one seemed to know that the great bird had been
killed, and many stood by the wayside to see the feathers that had been
torn from its wings, and catch a glimpse of its destroyer.</p>
<p>Near the middle of the day the great gathering arrived at Waikiki.
As many carried spears, it resembled an army in its march, and
messengers were despatched by the king to ascertain its meaning.
Halting near the shores of the harbor, and not far from the royal
mansion, to report the arrival of the prisoners and learn the pleasure
of the king, the prince observed his double canoe drawn up on the
beach, and requested permission to approach it, that he might secure
the counsel of his master, Kaululaau, son of the <i>moi</i> of
Maui.</p>
<p>The favor could not well be denied, and, under guard of two inferior
priests of Kukaniloko, the prince was conducted to the canoe. As but
three or four of the crew were present, and their attention was wholly
absorbed in the gathering around the royal <i>hale</i>, the prince
stepped, unobserved by them, into the canoe, and passed quickly into
his private quarters&mdash;a close <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223"
href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>wicker-work apartment eight
or ten feet in length by the breadth of both canoes, and with a height
of six feet or more from their bottoms to the top screen.</p>
<p>Hurriedly investing himself with his regalia of rank, including
helmet, feather mantle and spear, he stepped into view and sounded a
blast upon a shell. Soon a number of his attendants made their
appearance, and, with such following as befitted a prince, he started
for the royal mansion. The guards who escorted him to the canoe did not
recognize him as he left it, and after passing the crowd surrounding
the palace his name and rank were announced to the king. He was
promptly met and courteously welcomed at the door by Kalona, and
informed that messengers of greeting and invitation would have been
despatched to him had his presence at Waikiki been known.</p>
<p>Kaululaau then apprised the king that he had but just arrived
overland from Waialua, while his double canoe had been sent around to
meet him at Waikiki, and that it was his purpose to spend some days on
Oahu. The hospitalities of the royal <i>hale</i> were then tendered and
accepted, after which the king explained to his distinguished guest the
cause of the large gathering around the palace, and invited him to an
inspection of the head, feathers and claws of the mighty
<i>Pueoalii</i>, and to listen to the story of the slayer of the sacred
bird, should he deem it of sufficient interest.</p>
<p>Kaululaau accompanied the king to a large dancing pavilion within
the royal enclosure, to which had been conveyed the severed parts of
the gigantic bird. After the claws and feathers had been examined with
awe and amazement, the king ordered the slayer of the bird to be
brought before him. The high-priest of Kukaniloko bowed and turned to
execute the order, when the guards placed over the prince came from the
beach with the information that their prisoner had escaped.</p>
<p>The priest was savage in his disappointment. &ldquo;Either find him
or take his place upon the altar!&rdquo; he hissed to the unfortunate
guards, and then led Kamakaua before the king, with the explanation
that the other prisoner had managed to elude the vigilance of his
guards, but would doubtless soon be found.</p>
<p>Kamakaua discovered the prince at the side of the king, and could
hardly restrain a smile. When questioned he denied that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>he
killed the great bird, but admitted that he assisted in removing the
head, feathers and one of the feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is trifling,&rdquo; said the king, turning to the priest
with a scowl. &ldquo;Where is the other prisoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is here, great king!&rdquo; exclaimed Kaululaau, bowing
before Kalona, to the astonishment but great relief of the priest.
&ldquo;Favored by the gods, I slew the malignant monster your priests
call by the sacred name of <i>Pueoalii</i>. Their skill should have
instructed them differently. Will the king favor me by ordering the
<i>kapa</i> covering to be removed from the head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The order was given, and the uncovered head was raised beak upward
before the king.</p>
<p>In a moment it was observed that the head was not of a <i>pueo</i>,
or owl; nor did it bear resemblance in form to that of any bird known.
It was narrow between the eyes, which in color were those of a shark,
and its long and pointed beak, both of the upper and under jaws, turned
sharply upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a <i>pueo</i>!&rdquo; was the general
exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you satisfied, priest?&rdquo; inquired the prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is not a <i>pueo</i>,&rdquo; responded the priest,
reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>think</i> it is not a <i>pueo</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed
the king, indignantly. &ldquo;Do you not <i>know</i> it? What
<i>pueo</i> ever had such eyes and such a beak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest hung his head in confusion, and the prince, having
completely discomfited him, now came kindly to his relief by
remarking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mistake might well have been made, for on the wing and at
a distance the bird much resembled a <i>pueo</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are kind to say so, prince,&rdquo; said the king;
&ldquo;but the priests and <i>kaulas</i> have been greatly at fault.
For years the bird has preyed upon the people, and no one has dared to
molest it. Since you killed it, knowing that it was not sacred, perhaps
you may be able to tell me something of its unnatural birth and
appetites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus appealed to, Kaululaau modestly replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I may rely upon what seemed to be a dream last night, the
bird was possessed by the spirit of Hilo-a-Lakapu, one of the chiefs of
Hawaii who invaded Oahu during the reign of your royal father. He was
slain at Waimano, and his head was placed upon a pole near Honouliuli
for the birds to feed upon. He was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225"
href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>of <i>akua</i> blood, and
through a bird-god relative his spirit was given possession of the
monster which the gods enabled me to slay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spirit of Hilo had been brought in with the head of the dead
bird, and with the utterance of these words by the prince the eyes
rolled, the ponderous jaws opened and closed, and with a noise like the
scream of an <i>alae</i> the malignant spirit took its departure.</p>
<p>The truth of the dream of Kaululaau thus being verified, the king
publicly thanked him for ridding the island of the monstrous scourge,
and ordered especial honors to be paid him by all classes so long as it
might be his pleasure to remain in the kingdom. In return the prince
presented to the king the head, claws and feathers of the bird, the
latter to be made into a mammoth <i>kahili</i>, and then made Kamakaua
known to him, together with such other chiefs in his train as were
entitled to royal recognition.</p>
<p>Kaululaau became at once the hero of the court as well as the idol
of the people. He remained more than a month on Oahu, enjoying the
unstinted hospitality of the king and his district chiefs. He was a
favorite with the fairest women of the court; but he gave his heart to
the beautiful Laiea-a-Ewa, sister of the wife of Kalona, and with her
returned to Maui.</p>
<p>Landing at Lahaina after his long absence, he was joyfully welcomed
home by his royal father, who had heard of his adventures and fully
forgiven the faults of his youth. With grief he learned that his friend
the high-priest, Waolani, had died some months before. Remembering his
oath, he found the burial place of the priest, and with his remains
secretly deposited the sacred spear-point of Lono, which had served him
so effectively. He devoutly kissed the relic before he hid it for ever
from view, and afterwards knelt and thanked Lono and the priest for its
use.</p>
<p>Lands were given him in Kauaula, where he resided until the end of
his days. Laiea was his only wife, and they were blessed with six
children, whose names alone are mentioned by tradition. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Kelea, of whom in the past the bards of Oahu and Maui
loved to sing, was the beautiful but capricious sister of Kawao, king
of Maui, who in about <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1445, at the age of
twenty-five, succeeded to the sovereignty of that island. Their royal
father was Kahekili I., the son of Kakae, who, with his brother,
Kakaalaneo, was the joint ruler of the little realm from about 1380 to
1415. Kakae was the rightful heir to the <i>moiship</i>, and, as such,
his son Kahekili succeeded him; but as an accident in his youth had
somewhat impaired his mental faculties, Kakaalaneo became, through the
expressed will of the dying Kamaloohua, the joint ruler and virtual
sovereign of the kingdom. He had sons and daughters of his own; but he
loved his weak-minded brother, and respected the line of legitimate
succession, and when the black <i>kapa</i> covered him, Kahekili became
king of Maui and Lanai; for during that period the latter island was
under the protection of the <i>mois</i> of Maui, while Molokai still
maintained its independence.</p>
<p>Kakaalaneo was noted for his business energy and strict sense of
justice. The court of the brothers was established at
Lahaina&mdash;then known as Lele&mdash;and was one of the most
respected in all the group. It was Kakaalaneo who introduced the
bread-fruit there from Hawaii, and won the love of the people by
continuous acts of mercy and benevolence. For some disrespect shown to
his royal brother, whose mental weakness doubtless subjected him to
unkind remarks, he banished his son Kaululaau to Lanai, which island,
tradition avers, was at that time infested by powerful and malignant
spirits. They killed pigs and fowls, uprooted cocoanut-trees and
blighted <i>taro</i> patches, and a gigantic and mischievous gnome
amused himself by gliding like a huge mole under the huts of his
victims and almost upsetting them.</p>
<p>The priests tried in vain to quiet these malicious spirits. No
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>sooner were they exorcised away from one
locality than they appeared in another, and if they gave the
<i>taro</i> patches a rest it was only to tear the unripe bananas from
their stems, or rend the walls and embankments of artificial ponds,
that their stores of fishes might escape to the sea. Aware of these
grievances, Kaululaau took with him to Lanai a talisman of rare powers.
It was the gift of his friend, the high-priest of his father, and
consisted of a spear-point that had been dipped in the waters of
<i>Po</i>, the land of death, and many generations before left by
<i>Lono</i> on one of his altars.</p>
<p>Crowning a long spear with this sacred point, Kaululaau attacked the
disturbing spirits, and in a short time succeeded either in bringing
them to submission or driving them from the island. The gnome
<i>Mooaleo</i> was the most difficult to vanquish. It avoided the
prince, and for some time managed to keep beyond the influence of the
charmed spear-point; but the monster was finally caught within the
boundaries of a circular line scratched with the talisman upon the
surface of the earth beneath which it was burrowing, and thereby
brought to terms. It could not pass the line, no matter how far below
the surface it essayed to do so. Heaving the earth in its strength and
wrath, it chafed against the charmed restraint that held it captive,
and finally plunged downward within the vertical walls of its prison.
But there was no path of escape in that direction. It soon encountered
a lake of fire, and was compelled to return to the surface, where it
humbled itself before the prince, and promised, if liberated, to quit
the island for ever. Kaululaau obliterated sixty paces of the line of
imprisonment, to enable <i>Mooaleo</i> to pass to the sea, into which
the hideous being plunged and disappeared, never to be seen again in
Lanai.</p>
<p>In consideration of the great service of the exiled prince in
restoring quiet and security to the island, his father permitted him to
return to Maui, where he connected himself with the priesthood, and
became noted for his supernatural powers. The charmed spear-point is
referred to in later legends, and is thought to be still secreted with
the bones of a high-priest in a mountain cave on the island of Maui,
not far from the sacred burial-place of Iao.</p>
<p>But we have been straying two generations back of our story. The
legendary accounts of the ruling families of the principal <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>islands of the group are so threaded with
romantic or fabulous incidents that, in referring to any of the
prominent actors in the past, it is difficult to restrain the pen in
its willingness to wander into the enchanted by-ways in which the
<i>meles</i> of the period abound.</p>
<p>Having alluded to the immediate ancestors of Kelea, the sister of
the young <i>moi</i> of Maui, we will now resume the thread of our
legend by referring somewhat more particularly to the princess herself.
Brought up in the royal court at Lahaina, with a brother only to divide
the affections of her father, Kelea was humored, petted and spoiled as
a child, and courted and flattered beyond measure as she grew to
womanhood. The <i>meles</i> describe her as a maiden of uncommon
beauty; but she was wayward, volatile and capricious, as might have
been expected of one so schooled and favored, and no consideration of
policy or persuasion of passion could move her to accept any one of the
many high chiefs who sought her in marriage. She loved the
water&mdash;possibly because she could see her fair face mirrored in
it&mdash;and became the most graceful and daring surf-swimmer in the
kingdom. Frequently, when the waters of Auau Channel surged wildly
under the breath of the south wind, or <i>kona</i>, Kelea, laughing at
the fears of her brother, would plunge into the sea with her
<i>onini</i>, or surf-board, and so audaciously ride the waves that
those who watched and applauded her were half-inclined to believe that
she was the friend of some water-god, and could not be drowned.</p>
<p>No sport was to her so enticing as a battle with the waves, and when
her brother spoke to her of marriage she gaily answered that the
surf-board was her husband, and she would never embrace any other. The
brother frowned at the answer, for he had hoped, by uniting his sister
to the principal chief of Hana, to more thoroughly incorporate in his
kingdom that portion of the island, then ruled by independent chiefs;
but by other means during his reign, it may be remarked, the union of
the two divisions was effected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not frown, Kawao,&rdquo; said Kelea, coaxingly; &ldquo;a
smile better becomes your handsome face. I may marry some day, just to
please you; but remember what the voice said in the <i>anu</i> at the
last feast of <i>Lono</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; replied Kawao; &ldquo;but I have
sometimes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>believed that when the <i>kilo</i> declared that
in riding the surf Kelea would find a husband, he was simply repeating
an augury imparted to him by Kelea herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will anger the gods by speaking so lightly of their
words,&rdquo; returned Kelea, reproachfully; and Kawao smiled as the
princess took her leave with a dignity quite unusual with her.</p>
<p>Kawao loved his sister and was proud of her beauty; and while he was
anxious to see her suitably married, and felt no little annoyance at
the importunities of her suitors, he nevertheless recognized her right,
as the daughter of a king, to a voice in the selection of a
husband.</p>
<p>But the voice from the <i>anu</i> was prophetic, whatever may have
inspired it; for while Kelea continued to ride the waves at Lahaina, a
husband, of the family of Kalona-iki, of Oahu, was in search of her,
and to that island we now request the reader to follow us.</p>
<p>There lived at that time at Lihue, in the district of Ewa, on the
island of Oahu, a chief named Lo-Lale, son of Kalona-iki, and brother
of Piliwale, the <i>alii-nui</i>, or nominal sovereign, of the island,
whose court was established at Waialua. Kalona-iki had married Kikinui,
and thus infused into the royal family the native and aristocratic
blood of Maweke, of the ancient line of Nanaula.</p>
<p>Lo-Lale was an amiable and handsome prince, but for some cause had
reached the age of thirty-five without marrying. The reason was traced
to the death by drowning, some years before, of a chiefess of great
beauty whom he was about to marry, and to whom he was greatly attached.
As he was of a gentle and poetic nature, his disinclination to marriage
may not be unreasonably attributed to that event, especially when
supported by the relation that thereafter he abhorred the sea, and was
content to remain at Lihue, beyond the sound of its ceaseless
surges.</p>
<p>Piliwale had passed his fiftieth year, and, having but two daughters
and no son, was more than ever desirous that his brother should marry,
that the family authority might be strengthened and the line of Kalona
perpetuated. And the friendly neighboring chiefs were equally anxious
that Lo-Lale should become the head of a family, and, to inspire him
with a disposition to marry, described with enthusiasm the beauty of
many maidens <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>of distinguished rank whom they had met on the
other islands of the group.</p>
<p>To these importunities Lo-Lale finally yielded; and as a suitable
wife for so high a chief could not be found on Oahu, or, at least, one
who would be personally acceptable to him, it was necessary to seek for
her among the royal families of the other islands. Accordingly, a large
<i>koa</i> canoe was fitted out at Waialua, and with trusty messengers
of rank despatched to the windward islands in search of a wife for
Lo-Lale. The messengers were instructed to quietly visit the several
royal courts, and report upon the beauty, rank and eligibility of such
marriageable chiefesses of distinguished families as they might be able
to discover.</p>
<p>Among the chiefs selected for the delicate mission, and the one upon
whose judgment the most reliance was placed, was Lo-Lale&rsquo;s
cousin, Kalamakua, a noble of high rank, whose lands were on the coast
of the Ewa district. He was bold, dashing and adventurous, and readily
consented to assist in finding a wife for his royal and romantic
relative.</p>
<p>Lo-Lale was at Waialua when the messengers embarked. He took an
encouraging interest in the expedition, and when banteringly asked by
his cousin if age would be any objection in a bride of unexceptionable
birth, replied that he had promised to take a wife solely to please his
royal brother, and any age under eighty would answer. But he did not
mean it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; replied Piliwale, more than half in earnest.
&ldquo;I will not become the uncle of a family of monsters. The bride
must be as worthy in person as in blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear, Kalamakua?&rdquo; said Lo-Lale, addressing his
cousin, who was standing beside the canoe, ready for departure;
&ldquo;do you hear the words of Piliwale? She must be not only young
but beautiful. If you bring or give promise to any other, she shall not
live at Lihue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not fear,&rdquo; replied the cousin, gaily.
&ldquo;Whomsoever she may be, we will keep her in the family; for if
you refuse her, or she you, I will marry her myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairly spoken!&rdquo; exclaimed the king; &ldquo;and I will
see that he keeps his promise, Lo-Lale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the object of the voyage was known to but few, hundreds
gathered at the beach to witness the departure, for the canoe was
decorated, and the embarking chiefs appeared in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>feather capes and other ornaments of their rank.
Turning to the high-priest, who was present, Piliwale asked him if he
had observed the auguries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; replied the priest. &ldquo;They are more than
favorable.&rdquo; Then turning his face northward, he continued:
&ldquo;There is peace in the clouds, and the listless winging of yonder
bird betokens favoring winds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amid a chorus of <i>alohas!</i> the canoe dashed through the
breakers and out into the open sea, holding a course in the direction
of Molokai. Reaching that island early the next day, the party landed
at Kalaupapa. The <i>alii-nui</i> received them well, but inquiry led
to nothing satisfactory, and, proceeding around the island, the party
next landed on Lanai. It is probable that they were driven there by
unfavorable winds, as Lanai was a dependency of Maui at that time, and
none but subject chiefs resided on the island. However, they remained
there but one day, and the next proceeded to Hana, Maui, with the
intention of crossing over to Hawaii and visiting the court of Kiha at
Waipio. Inquiring for the <i>moi</i>, they learned that Kawao had
removed his court from Lahaina, for the season, to Hamakuapoko, to
enjoy the cool breezes of that locality and indulge in the pleasures of
surf-bathing. They were further informed that a large number of chiefs
had accompanied the <i>moi</i> to that attractive resort, and that
Kelea, sister of the king, and the most beautiful woman on the island
as well as the most daring and accomplished surf-swimmer, was also
there as one of the greatest ornaments of the court.</p>
<p>This was agreeable information, and the party re-embarked and
arrived the next morning off Hamakuapoko, just as the fair Kelea and
her attendants had gone down to the beach to indulge in a buffet with
the surf. Swimming out beyond the breakers, and oblivious of everything
but her own enjoyment, Kelea suddenly found herself within a few yards
of the canoe of the Oahuan chiefs. Presuming that it contained her own
people, she swam still closer, when she discovered, to her amazement,
that all the faces in the canoe were strange to her. Perceiving her
embarrassment, Kalamakua rose to his feet, and, addressing her in a
courtly and respectful manner, invited her to a seat in the canoe,
offering to ride the surf with it to the beach&mdash;an exciting and
sometimes dangerous sport, in which great skill and coolness are
required. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span></p>
<p>The language of the chief was so gentle and suggestive of the
manners of the court that the invitation was accepted, and the canoe
mounted one of the great waves successively following two of lighter
bulk and force, and was adroitly and safely beached. The achievement
was greeted with applause on the shore, and when the proposal was made
to repeat the performance Kelea willingly retained her seat. Again the
canoe successfully rode the breakers ashore, and then, through her
attendants, Kalamakua discovered that the fair and dashing swimmer was
none other than Kelea, the sister of the <i>moi</i> of Maui.</p>
<p>With increased respect Kalamakua again invited his distinguished
guest to join in the pleasure and excitement of a third ride over the
breakers. She consented, and the canoe was once more pulled out beyond
the surf, where it remained for a moment, awaiting a high, combing
roller on which to be borne to the landing. One passed and was missed,
and before another came a squall, or what was called a <i>mumuku</i>,
suddenly struck the canoe, rendering it utterly unmanageable and
driving it out upon the broad ocean.</p>
<p>When the canoe started Kelea would have leaped into the sea had she
not been restrained; but Kalamakua spoke so kindly to
her&mdash;assuring her that they would safely ride out the storm and
return to Hamakuapoko&mdash;that she became calmer, and consented to
curl down beside him in the boat to escape the fury of the winds. Her
shapely limbs and shoulders were bare, and her hair, braided and bound
loosely back, was still wet, and grew chilling in the wind where it
fell. Kalamakua took from a covered calabash a handsome <i>kihei</i>,
or mantle, and wrapped it around her shoulders, and then seated her in
the shelter of his own burly form. She smiled her thanks for these
delicate attentions, and the chief was compelled to admit to himself
that the reports of her great beauty had not been exaggerated. He could
recall no maiden on Oahu who was her equal in grace and comeliness, and
felt that, could she be secured for his eccentric cousin, his search
would be at an end. He even grew indignant at the thought that she
might not prove acceptable, but smiled the next moment at his promise
to marry the girl himself should she be refused by his cousin.</p>
<p>But the fierce <i>mumuku</i> afforded him but little time to indulge
such dreams. The sea surged in fury, and like a cockleshell the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>canoe was tossed from one huge wave to another.
The spray was almost blinding, and, while Kalamakua kept the little
craft squarely before the wind as a measure of first importance, his
companions were earnestly employed in alternately baling and trimming
as emergency suggested.</p>
<p>On, on sped the canoe, farther and farther out into the open sea,
tossed like a feather by the crested waves and pelted by the driving
spray. The scene was fearful. The southern skies had grown black with
wrath, and long streamers sent from the clouds shot northward as if to
surround and cut off the retreat of the flying craft. All crouched in
the bottom of the boat, intent only on keeping it before the wind and
preventing it from filling. A frailer craft would have been stove to
pieces; but it was hewn from the trunk of a sound <i>koa</i> tree, and
gallantly rode out the storm.</p>
<p>But when the wind ceased and the skies cleared, late in the
afternoon, the canoe was far out at sea and beyond the sight of land.
It was turned and headed back; but as there was no wind to assist the
paddles, and the waters were still rough and restless, slow progress
toward land was made; and when the sun went down Kalamakua was
undecided which way to proceed, as he was not certain that the storm
had not carried them so far from the coast of Maui that some point on
Molokai or Oahu might be more speedily and safely reached than the
place from which they started. Their supply of <i>poi</i> had been lost
during the gale by the breaking of the vessel containing it; but they
had still left a small quantity of dried fish, raw potatoes and
bananas, and a calabash of water, and ate their evening meal as
cheerfully as if their supplies were exhaustless and the green hills of
Waialua smiled upon them in the distance. Such was the Hawaiian of the
past; such is the Hawaiian of to-day. His joys and griefs are centred
in the present, and he broods but little over the past, and borrows no
trouble from the future.</p>
<p>The stars came out, and a light wind began to steal down upon them
from the northwest. It was quite chilly, and felt like the breath of
the returning trade-winds, which start from the frozen shores of
northwestern America, and gradually grow warmer as they sweep down
through the tropic seas. These winds, continuing, with intervals of
cessation, eight or nine months in the year, are what give life, beauty
and an endurable climate to the Hawaiian group. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span></p>
<p>As the breeze freshened sails were raised, and then the course to be
taken remained to be determined. Kalamakua expressed his doubts to
Kelea, as if inviting a suggestion from her; but she was unable to
offer any advice, declaring that she had not noticed the course of the
wind that had driven them so far out upon the ocean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am equally in doubt,&rdquo; said the chief. &ldquo;We
may have been blown farther toward the rising of the sun than the
headlands of Hana. If so, the course we are now sailing would take us
to Hawaii, if not, indeed, beyond, while in following the evening star
we might even pass Oahu. I therefore suggest a course between these two
directions, which will certainly bring us to land some time
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, since we are all in doubt,&rdquo; replied Kelea,
&ldquo;and the winds are blowing landward, why not trust to the gods
and follow them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your words are an inspiration,&rdquo; returned the chief,
delighted that she had suggested a course that would enable him to make
Oahu direct; for, as may be suspected, he was an accomplished
navigator, and was really in little or no doubt concerning the
direction of the several islands mentioned. &ldquo;You have spoken
wisely,&rdquo; he continued, as if yielding entirely to her judgment;
&ldquo;we will follow the winds that are now cooling the shores of
Hamakuapoko.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus adroitly was Kelea made a consenting party to her own
abduction. Kalamakua took the helm, slightly changing the course of the
canoe, and his companions made themselves comfortable for the evening.
Their wet rolls of <i>kapa</i> had been dried during the afternoon, and
there was room enough to spare to arrange a couch for Kelea in the
bottom of the boat. But she was too much excited over the strange
events of the day to sleep, or even attempt to rest, and therefore sat
near Kalamakua in the stern of the canoe until past midnight, watching
the stars and listening to the story, with which he knew she must
sooner or later become acquainted, of his romantic expedition in search
of a wife for his cousin.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that Kalea was surprised and interested in the
relation; and when Kalamakua referred to the high rank of his cousin,
to his handsome person and large estates at Lihue, and begged her to
regard with favor the proposal of marriage <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>which he then made to her in behalf of Lo-Lale,
she frankly replied that, if her royal brother did not object, she
would give the proffer consideration.</p>
<p>As Kalamakua had concluded not to take the hazard of securing the
consent of her brother, who doubtless had some other matrimonial
project in view for her, he construed her answer into a modestly
expressed willingness to become the wife of Lo-Lale, and the more
resolutely bent his course toward Oahu. He watched the
Pleiades&mdash;the great guide of the early Polynesian
navigators&mdash;as they swept up into the heavens, and, bearing still
farther to the northward to escape Molokai, announced that he would
keep the steering-oar for the night, and advised his companions, now
that the breeze was steady and the sea smoother, to betake themselves
to rest. And Kelea at last curled down upon her couch of <i>kapa</i>,
and Kalamakua was left alone with his thoughts to watch the wind and
stars.</p>
<p>Although a long and steady run had been made during the night, no
land was visible the next morning. Kelea scanned the horizon uneasily,
and, without speaking, looked at Kalamakua for an explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the sun goes down we shall see land,&rdquo; said the
chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What land?&rdquo; inquired Kelea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oahu,&rdquo; was the reply, but the chief was not greeted
with the look of surprise expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not disappointed,&rdquo; returned the princess, quite
indifferently. &ldquo;You seem to have been sailing by the wandering
stars last night, for before daylight I looked up and saw by <i>Kao</i>
that your course was directly toward the place of sunset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five of the planets&mdash;Mercury, Mars, Venus, Jupiter and
Saturn&mdash;were known to the ancient Hawaiians, and designated as
<i>na hoku aea</i>, or wandering stars. The fixed stars were also
grouped by them into constellations, and <i>Kao</i> was their name for
Antares.</p>
<p>With a look of genuine surprise Kalamakua replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know before that so correct a knowledge of
navigation was among the many accomplishments of the sister of
Kawao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It required no great knowledge of the skies to discover last
night that we were not bearing southward, and needs still less
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>now to observe that we are sailing directly
west,&rdquo; Kelea quietly remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not attempt to deceive one who seems to be able to
instruct me in journeying over the blue waters,&rdquo; said Kalamakua,
politely. &ldquo;Your judgment is correct. We are sailing nearly
westward, and the first land sighted will probably be the headlands of
Kaawa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have acted treacherously,&rdquo; resumed the princess,
after a pause, as if suddenly struck with the propriety of protesting
against the abduction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; was the brief reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she continued, after another pause, &ldquo;you
have acted treacherously, and my brother will make war upon Oahu unless
I am immediately returned to Hamakuapoko.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will find work for his spears,&rdquo; was the irritating
response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a habit with the chiefs of Oahu to steal their
wives?&rdquo; inquired Kelea, tauntingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Kalamakua promptly replied; &ldquo;but I would not
eat from the same calabash with the chief who would throw back into the
face of the generous winds the gift of the rarest flower that ever
blossomed on Hawaiian soil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pretty compliment of the chief moved Kelea to silence; yet he
observed that there was a sparkle of pleasure in her eyes, and that the
novelty and romance of the situation were not altogether distasteful to
her.</p>
<p>Land was sighted late in the afternoon. It was Kaoio Point, on the
western side of Oahu. Rounding it, they landed at Mahana, where they
procured food and water and passed the night, and the next day had an
easy voyage to Waialua.</p>
<p>Landing, Kalamakua at once communicated with Piliwale, giving the
high rank of Kelea, as well as the strange circumstances under which
she had been brought to Waialua. Queen Paakanilea promptly despatched
attendants to the beach with appropriate apparel, and in due time the
distinguished visitor was received at the royal mansion in a manner
consistent with her rank.</p>
<p>The next day a message brought Lo-Lale from Lihue. He was dressed in
his richest trappings, and brought with him, as an offering to Kelea, a
rare necklace of shells and curiously-carved mother-of-pearl. He was
conducted to the princess by Kalamakua. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb240" href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>They seemed to be
mutually pleased with each other. In fact, Lo-Lale was completely
charmed by the fair stranger, and in his enthusiasm offered to divide
his estates with his cousin as an evidence of his gratitude.</p>
<p>Kalamakua had himself become very much interested in Kelea, and
secretly hoped that his cousin might find something in her blood or
bearing to object to, in which case he felt that she might be induced
to regard his own suit with favor; but Lo-Lale declared her to be a
model of perfection, and wooed her with so much earnestness that she
finally consented to become his wife without waiting to hear from her
brother.</p>
<p>Her rank was quite equal to that of Lo-Lale, and the king was so
greatly pleased with the union that he added considerably to the
estates of his brother at Lihue, and the nuptials were celebrated with
games, feasting, dancing and the commencement of a new <i>heiau</i>
near Waialua, which was in time completed and dedicated to <i>Lono</i>,
with a large image of <i>Laamaomao</i>, the Hawaiian &AElig;olus, at
the inner entrance, in poetic commemoration of the winds that drove
Kelea away from the coast of Maui.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the festivities at Waialua, Kelea was borne all
the way to Lihue in a richly-mounted <i>manele</i>, or native palanquin
with four bearers. There were three hundred attendants in her train,
exclusive of thirty-six chiefs as a guard of honor, wearing feather
capes and helmets, and armed with javelins festooned with <i>leis</i>
of flowers and tinted feathers. It was a right royal procession, and
its entrance into Lihue was the beginning of another round of
festivities continuing for many days. Portions of the <i>mele</i>
recited by Lo-Lale in welcome of his wife to Lihue are still remembered
and repeated, and the occasion was a popular theme of song and comment
for a generation or more among the people of that district.</p>
<p>And thus Kelea, the beautiful sister of the <i>moi</i> of Maui,
became the wife of Lo-Lale, brother of Piliwale, king of Oahu.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is now in order to return to Hamakuapoko, to note
what transpired there on the sudden disappearance of Kelea before the
strong breath of the <i>mumuku</i>. The king was profoundly grieved,
and summoned the attendants of his sister to learn the particulars
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>of the misfortune. To all of them it was
manifest that the canoe had been blown out to sea in spite of the
efforts of its occupants, and, as the gale continued to increase in
violence during the day, it was feared that the entire party had
perished. As to the strangers, no one seemed to know anything of them
or of the island from which they came. They did not seem to belong to
the <i>makaainana</i>, or common people, and one of them, it was
believed from his bearing, was a high chief.</p>
<p>This was all the information the wailing attendants were able to
give. One man, who had noticed the canoe as it came and went through
the surf, thought it was from Hawaii, while another was equally certain
that it was from Oahu; but as the general structure of canoes on the
several islands of the group differed but little, their descriptions of
the craft furnished no real clue to the mystery.</p>
<p>With the cessation of the storm, late in the afternoon, came a hope
to Kawao that the missing canoe had safely ridden out the gale, and
would seek the nearest land favored by the changing winds. He therefore
summoned the high-priest, and instructed him to put his diviners and
magicians to the task of discovering what had become of the princess
Kelea. Pigs and fowls were slain, prayers were said in the
<i>heiau</i>, and late in the evening information came through
supernatural agencies that Kelea was still living. But this was not
satisfactory to the king. He demanded something more specific, and a
<i>kaula</i> of great sanctity was prepared and placed in the
<i>anu</i>, a wicker enclosure within the inner court, and in due time,
in answer to the questions of the high-priest, announced that the canoe
containing the princess was sailing in safety toward Oahu.</p>
<p>The words of the <i>kaula</i> were repeated to the king, and the
next day he despatched a well-manned canoe, in charge of one of his
plumed <i>halumanus</i>, or military aids, to find and bring back the
lost Kelea. Owing to unfavorable winds or bad management the canoe did
not reach Makapuu Point, Oahu, until the fourth day. Proceeding along
the northeastern coast of the island, and landing wherever practicable
to make inquiries, the easy-going messenger did not arrive at Waialua
until two days after the departure of Kelea for Lihue.</p>
<p>Learning that the princess had become the wife of Lo-Lale, the
disappointed <i>halumanu</i> did not deem it necessary to communicate
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>with her, but briefly paid his respects to the
king, to whom he made known the nature of his errand to Oahu, and his
resolution to return at once to Maui and acquaint his royal master with
the result of his mission.</p>
<p>Appreciating that, in his anxiety to see his brother properly mated,
he had countenanced a proceeding sufficiently discourteous to the
<i>moi</i> of Maui to warrant a hostile response, Piliwale treated the
<i>halumanu</i> with marked kindness and consideration, and insisted
upon sending an escort with him back to Maui, including the bearer of a
friendly explanatory message from himself to Kawao. For this delicate
service no one could be found so competent as the courtly Kalamakua,
who was well versed in the genealogy of the Kalona family, and would be
able to satisfactorily, if not quite truthfully, explain why it was
that the canoe containing the princess, when driven out to sea, was
headed for Oahu instead of Maui when the storm abated.</p>
<p>Kalamakua was accordingly despatched on the mission. Being a much
better sailor than the <i>halumanu</i>, he found no difficulty either
in parting company with him off the coast of eastern Maui or in
reaching Hamakuapoko three or four hours in advance of the party he was
courteously escorting thither. This enabled the wily Oahuan to secure
an audience with the king, and deliver his message and explanation in
full, before the <i>halumanu</i> could land and give his version of the
story.</p>
<p>Kalamakua&rsquo;s explanation of the impossibility, after the storm,
of reaching in safety any land other than Oahu or Molokai, seemed to be
satisfactory; and when he dwelt upon the well-known high rank of
Lo-Lale, as recognized by the <i>aha-alii</i>, and referred to his
manly bearing, his amiable disposition and the amplitude of his
estates, Kawao answered sadly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then so let it be. It is perhaps the will of the gods. I
would have had it otherwise; but be to Kelea and her husband, and to my
royal brother the king of Oahu, my messenger of peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanking the <i>moi</i> for his kindly words, Kalamakua took his
leave. As he was about to re-embark in the afternoon for Oahu, the
discomfited <i>halumanu</i>, having but just then landed, passed him on
the beach. Knowing that he had been outwitted, in his wrath he reached
for the handle of his knife. But he did not draw it. Kalamakua stopped
and promptly answered the challenge; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb243" href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>but the
<i>halumanu</i> passed on, and with a smile he stepped into his canoe,
and a few minutes later was on his way to Oahu with Kawao&rsquo;s
welcome messages of peace.</p>
<p>As the years came and went in their quiet home at Lihue, Lo-Lale
lost none of his affection for Kelea. No wars distracted the group.
Liloa, the son of Kiha and father of Umi, had become the peaceful
sovereign of Hawaii; Kahakuma, the ancestor of some of the most
distinguished families of the islands, held gentle and intelligent sway
in Kauai; Kawao still ruled in Maui, and Piliwale in Oahu.</p>
<p>To gratify his wife, Lo-Lale surrounded her with every comfort. The
choicest fruits of the island were at her command, and every day fresh
fish and other delicacies of the sea were brought to her from the
neighboring coasts. In short, everything not <i>tabu</i> to the sex was
provided without stint. Summer-houses were constructed for her in the
cool recesses of the Waianae Mountains, and a <i>manele</i>, with
relays of stout bearers, was always at her service for the briefest
journeys. The people of the district were proud of her rank and beauty,
and at seasons of <i>hookupu</i>, or gift-making, she was fairly
deluged with rare and valuable offerings.</p>
<p>Yet, with all this affluence of comfort and affection, Kelea became
more and more restless and unhappy. Nor did the presence of her
children, of whom she had three, seem to render her more contented. She
longed for the sea; for the bounding surf which had been the sport of
her girlhood; for the white-maned steeds of ocean, which she had so
often mounted and fearlessly ridden to the shore; for the thunder of
the breakers against the cliffs; for the murmur of the reef-bound
wavelets timidly crawling up the beach to kiss and cool her feet; and
the more she yearned for her old-time pleasures, the greater became her
dissatisfaction with the tamer life and surroundings of Lihue.</p>
<p>Knowing her love for the sea, Lo-Lale made occasional excursions
with her to the coast, frequently remaining there for days together.
Sometimes they visited the east and sometimes the south side of the
island; but the place which seemed to please her above all others was
Ewa, where Kalamakua made his home. He, too, loved the sea, and during
her visits there afforded her every opportunity to indulge her passion
for it. Together they had charming sails around the Puuloa (Pearl
River) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>lagoon, and gallant rides over the surf at the
entrance. There, and there only, did she seem to recover her spirits;
there only did she seem to be happy.</p>
<p>This did not escape the notice of Lo-Lale, and a great grief filled
his heart as he sometimes thought, in noting her brightened look in the
presence of Kalamakua, that it was less the charms of the surf than of
his cousin&rsquo;s handsome face that made the waters of Ewa so
attractive to Kelea.</p>
<p>Life at Lihue finally became so irksome to her, and even the
continued kindness of Lo-Lale so unwelcome, that she announced her
determination to leave the home of her husband for ever. This
resolution was not altogether unexpected by Lo-Lale, for he had not
been blind to her growing restlessness and was prepared for the worst;
and as the prerogatives of her high rank gave her the undoubted
privilege of separation if she desired it, he reluctantly consented to
the divorcement. When asked where it was her purpose to go, she
answered: &ldquo;Probably to Maui, to rejoin my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More probably not beyond Ewa,&rdquo; was Lo-Lale&rsquo;s
significant reply. &ldquo;But, no matter where you may go,&rdquo; he
continued, with dignity, &ldquo;take your departure from Lihue in a
manner consistent with your rank. You were received here as became the
sister of a king and the wife of the son of Kalona-iki. So would I have
you depart. I reproach you with nothing, myself with nothing; therefore
let us part in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We part in peace,&rdquo; was Kelea&rsquo;s only answer, and
the next morning she quietly took her departure with four or five
attendants. A chant expressive of Lo-Lale&rsquo;s grief at the
separation was long after recited, but these lines are all of it that
have been preserved:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Farewell, my partner on the lowland plains,</p>
<p class="line">On the waters of Pohakeo,</p>
<p class="line">Above Kanehoa,</p>
<p class="line">On the dark mountain spur of Mauna-una!</p>
<p class="line">O Lihue, she is gone!</p>
<p class="line">Sniff the sweet scent of the grass,</p>
<p class="line">The sweet scent of the wild vines</p>
<p class="line">That are twisted by Waikoloa,</p>
<p class="line">By the winds of Waiopua,</p>
<p class="line">My flower!</p>
<p class="line">As if a mote were in my eye, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">The pupil of my eye is troubled;</p>
<p class="line">Dimness covers my eyes. Woe is me!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Leaving Lihue, Kelea descended to Ewa, and, skirting
the head of the lagoon by way of Halawa, on the afternoon of the second
day arrived at the entrance, immediately opposite Puualoa. There she
found a large number of nobles and retainers of Kalamakua, the high
chief of the district, amusing themselves in the surf. As she had not
seen the salt water for some months, Kelea could not resist the
temptation to indulge in her old pastime, and, borrowing a surf-board
from one of the bathers, plunged into the sea, and soon joined the
party of surf-riders beyond the breakers.</p>
<p>Soon a huge roller made its appearance, and all mounted it and
started for the shore. The race was exciting, for the most expert
swimmers in the district were among the contestants; but in grace,
daring and skill Kelea very plainly excelled them all, and was loudly
cheered as she touched the shore. Kalamakua was reposing in the shade,
not far away, and, hearing the tumult of voices, inquired the cause. He
was told that a beautiful woman from Lihue had beaten all the chiefs at
surf-riding, and the people could not restrain their enthusiasm.
Satisfied that there was but one Lihue woman who could perform such a
feat, and that she must be Kelea, the wife of his cousin Lo-Lale, he
proceeded to the beach just as a second trial had resulted in a triumph
to the fair contestant quite as emphatic as the first. As she touched
the shore Kalamakua threw his <i>kihei</i> (mantle) over her shoulders
and respectfully greeted her. Kelea then informed him that she had
formally separated from her husband and was about to embark for
Maui.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is the case,&rdquo; said Kalamakua, gently taking her
by the arm, as if to restrain her, &ldquo;you will go no farther than
Ewa. When I went in search of a wife for Lo-Lale, I promised that if he
objected to the woman I brought or recommended, or she to him, I would
take her myself, if she so willed. You have objected to him. Is
Kalamakua better to your liking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will remain at Ewa,&rdquo; was the satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you should have gone there instead of to Lihue, when
you landed at Waialua years ago,&rdquo; continued Kalamakua,
earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My thought is the same,&rdquo; was Kelea&rsquo;s frank
avowal; and she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246"
name="pb246">246</a>]</span>beckoned to her attendants, and told
Kalamakua that she was ready to follow him.</p>
<p>Did he expect her at the beach that morning? Tradition offers no
direct answer to the question, but significantly mentions that
Kalamakua spent one or two days at Lihue not long before, that houses
were in readiness for her at Ewa, and that she was borne thither on a
<i>manele</i>, escorted by the principal chiefs and nobles of the
district.</p>
<p>Learning, not long after, that Kelea had become the wife of
Kalamakua, the gentle-hearted Lo-Lale sent to her a present of fruits
and a message of peace and forgiveness; but it was his request that
they might never meet again, and he spent the remainder of his days in
Lihue, caring for the welfare of his people and dreaming in the shadows
of the hills of Kaala.</p>
<p>But little more need here be told. Kelea and Kalamakua lived happily
together, and were blessed with a daughter, Laielohelohe, who inherited
her mother&rsquo;s beauty, and became the wife of her cousin Piilani,
son and successor of Kawao, <i>moi</i> of Maui; but it was not until
after the betrothal of the cousins, which was agreed to in their
childhood, that Kawao fully forgave his volatile sister for marrying a
prince of Oahu without his consent.</p>
<p>Piikea, one of the daughters of Piilani and Laielohelohe, became in
after-time the wife of the great Umi, of Hawaii, and through her
great-grandson, I, the ancestress of Kalakaua, the present sovereign of
the group. Lono-a-Pii, another of their children, succeeded his father
as <i>moi</i> of Maui.</p>
<p>As a further example of the manner in which the blood of the
reigning families of the several islands of the group was commingled in
the early periods of their history, it may be mentioned that Kaholi, a
son of Lo-Lale and Kelea, was united in marriage to Kohipa, one of the
two daughters of Piliwale; while the other, Kukaniloko, who followed
her father as sovereign of Oahu, became the wife of Luaia, grandson of
Kakaalaneo, the joint ruler of Maui during the reign of the unfortunate
Kakae. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=

<p class="first">Nowhere on the island of Hawaii do the palms grow
taller than in the valleys of Waipio, and nowhere is the foliage
greener, for every month in the year they are refreshed with rains, and
almost hourly cooled in the shadows of passing clouds.</p>
<p>And sweet are the waters that sing through the valleys of Waipio.
They are fed by the tears of the trade-winds gathered in the shaded
gorges of the mountains where they find their source, and are speeded
to the ocean by hurrying and impatient cascades through black channels
fretted with bowlders and fringed with everlasting green.</p>
<p>Tradition says the waters of Waipio, after their first descent from
the hills, at one time crawled quite sluggishly to the sea; but a great
fish&mdash;larger than the island of Kaula&mdash;whose home was in the
depths off the coast of Hamakua, required more fresh water than was
furnished by the principal stream of the valley, and <i>Kane</i>, who
was friendly with the monster, increased the volume of the little river
by creating new springs at its sources, and accelerating the flow by
raising the bed in places and providing additional riffles and
cascades. The great fish no longer frequents that part of the coast of
Hamakua, but the cascades and riffles remain, with the broad
finger-marks of <i>Kane</i> upon the rocks hurled into the gorge to
create them.</p>
<p>Although but thinly populated now, Waipio was for many generations
in the past a place of great political and social importance, and the
<i>tabus</i> of its great temple were the most sacred in all Hawaii.
For two hundred years or more it was the residence <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>of
the kings of that island, and was the scene of royal pageants, priestly
power and knightly adventure, as well as of many sanguinary
battles.</p>
<p>Waipio valley was first occupied as a royal residence by
Kahaimoelea, near the middle or close of the thirteenth century, and so
continued until after the death of Liloa, about the end of the
fifteenth century. For some reason not clearly stated the successor of
Liloa removed his court from Waipio to the opposite coast of the
island. Although the glory of the old capital departed with its
abandonment as the royal residence, the <i>tabus</i> of its great
temple of <i>Paakalani</i> continued to command supreme respect until
as late as 1791, when the <i>heiau</i> was destroyed, with all its
sacred symbols and royal associations, by the confederated forces of
Maui and Kauai in their war with Kamehameha I.</p>
<p>Although the story about to be related opens in the reign of Liloa,
which closed with his death in about 1485, it is pertinent to refer, as
briefly as the strange circumstances of the time will permit, to the
father of that sovereign&mdash;the great Kiha&mdash;concerning whose
career many curious traditions survive. The reign of Kiha was long and
peaceful. He was endowed not only with marked abilities as a ruler, but
with unusual physical strength and skill in the use of arms. In
addition to these natural advantages and accomplishments, which gave
him the respect and fear of his subjects, it was popularly believed
that he possessed supernatural resources, and could call to his aid, in
an emergency, weird forces in opposition to which mere human endeavor
would be weak and fruitless. Under the circumstances, it is not strange
that the chiefs of the neighboring islands deemed it prudent to court
his friendship, and that no great wars distracted the kingdom during
his reign.</p>
<p>Among the means at the command of Kiha for summoning to his
assistance the invisible forces subject to his call, the most potential
was a curious war-trumpet, the notes of which, when blown by Kiha,
could be heard a distance of ten miles, even from Waipio to Waimea.
According to the character of the blast, its voice was either a summons
to unseen powers, a rallying-cry to the people, or a dreadful challenge
to battle. This trumpet was a large sea-shell. It was a native of
foreign waters, and another like it could not be found in the Hawaiian
group. It was ornamented with rows of the teeth of distinguished chiefs
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>slain in battle, and could be so blown as to
bring forth the dying groans or battle cries of all of them in dreadful
diapason.</p>
<p>Many legends are related of the manner in which Kiha became
possessed of this marvellous shell, but the most probable explanation
is that it was brought from some one of the Samoan or Society Islands
three or four centuries before, and had been retained in the reigning
family of Hawaii as a charm against certain evils. In the hands of the
crafty Kiha, however, it developed new powers and became an object of
awe in the royal household. Whatever may have been the beneficent or
diabolic virtues of this shell-clarion of Kiha&mdash;of the
<i>Kiha-pu</i>, as it is called&mdash;its existence, at least, was a
reality, since it is to-day one of the attractions of the Royal
Hawaiian Museum of Honolulu, brought down by the Kamehameha branch of
the Kiha line. When vigorously blown it still responds in sonorous
voice, suggestive of the roar of breakers around the jutting cliffs of
Hamakua; but <i>Lono</i> no longer heeds the mandate of its call, and
brown-armed warriors come no more at its bidding. Of the many strange
stories still retained of the <i>Kiha-pu</i>, one is here given, nearly
in the language in which it has come down in Hawaiian chant and song.
<span class="sc">a story of the kiha-pu.</span></p>
<p>For a period of eight years, during the reign of Kiha, the
<i>Kiha-pu</i> was missing from the cabinet of royal charms and
treasures. A new temple was to be dedicated to <i>Lono</i>, not far
from Waipio, and feathers of the mamo, oo and other birds were required
to weave into royal mantles and redecorate <i>Kaili</i> and other gods
of the king&rsquo;s household. But one of the <i>Kahu alii</i>,
constituting the five classes of guardians of the royal person, was
permitted to touch the <i>Kiha-pu</i>, nor did any other know of its
depository in the king&rsquo;s chamber<span class="corr" id="xd26e7303"
title="Not in source">.</span> His name was Hiolo. He was the son of a
distinguished chief, and his office was that of <i>ipukuha</i>, or
spittoon-bearer&mdash;a position of peculiar responsibility, which
could be filled only by persons of noble blood and undoubted attachment
to their sovereign.</p>
<p>Desirous of hastily assembling and despatching to the neighboring
sea-shores and mountains a large party of feather-hunters, the king,
reclining in the shade of the palms in front of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>royal mansion, commanded Hiolo to bring to him
the <i>Kiha-pu</i>, that he might with a single blast summon his
subjects throughout the valleys of Waipio. Hiolo proceeded to the
chamber of the king, and a few minutes after returned pale and
speechless, and threw himself at the feet of Kiha, tearing his hair,
lacerating his flesh with his nails, and exhibiting other evidences of
extreme agony and desperation.</p>
<p>Nothing ever startled a sovereign of the line of Pili. Under all
circumstances he acted with apparent deliberation. It was a natural
trait, strengthened by example and education.</p>
<p>Kiha calmly regarded his <i>ipukuha</i> for a moment, and then
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What spirit of evil possesses you? Rise, Hiolo, and
speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiolo rose to his feet, and, with a look of despair, exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no fault of mine; but tear out the tongue that tells
you the <i>Kiha-pu</i> is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without replying, the king, with a terrible scowl upon his face,
rose and strode into his chamber. Parting the curtains of <i>kapa</i>
which secluded the back portion of the apartment, he stepped to an
elaborately carved and ornamented <i>ipu</i>, a container shaped and
hollowed from the trunk of a <i>koa</i> tree. He found the vessel open,
and beside it on the matted floor the several folds of <i>kapa</i> in
which the <i>Kiha-pu</i> had been wrapped; but instead of the sacred
trumpet he discovered at the bottom of the <i>ipu</i> a
hideously-carved head and face of stone. The shell had been adroitly
abstracted, but the image that had been left in its place saved the
life of Hiolo, for by it Kiha discerned that the theft and substitution
had been achieved through supernatural agencies.</p>
<p>The loss of the <i>Kiha-pu</i> was a great grief to the king. But he
did not deem it prudent to admit that he no longer possessed the sacred
talisman, and therefore announced to Hiolo that the trumpet had been
found. Under the pretence that it had been carelessly misplaced by
Hiolo, Kiha declared that he would be its sole guardian thereafter.</p>
<p>There was great joy at the court when it was learned from the lips
of the king that the <i>Kiha-pu</i> had been found; yet it was observed
that it was not used to summon the feather-hunters, and after the sun
went down that evening many thought they faintly heard the music of its
voice coming in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253"
name="pb253">253</a>]</span>from the sea. And the king detected the
familiar sound, and, fearful that others might hear it as well, called
together his poets and <i>hula</i> dancers, and permitted their
boisterous merriment far into the night.</p>
<p>Early in the evening, while the palace grounds were a scene of
revelry, the king repaired alone to the great temple of
<i>Paakalani</i>, not far from the royal mansion, to consult with the
high-priest and put in motion the weird forces of the <i>heiau</i> for
the recovery of the <i>Kiha-pu</i>. He took with him the image left in
the <i>ipu</i>, as a possible means of assistance, and enjoined a
solemn secrecy upon every <i>kahuna</i> taken into the confidence of
the high-priest.</p>
<p>The most noted <i>kilos</i>, seers and prophets of the temple were
ordered to apply their arts, and a <i>kaula</i>, inspired by
incantation, was questioned from within the <i>anu</i> of the inner
sanctuary. The clouds were noted, the flights of birds observed, and
the dreams of drugged priests interpreted, but nothing satisfactory was
developed. Prayers were offered to the gods, sacrifices were laid upon
the altar, and the vitals of freshly-slain pigs and fowls were
carefully examined; but the only information obtained was that the
<i>Kiha-pu</i> had been stolen by the chief of a band of demi-demons,
or human beings controlled by evil spirits; that it was no longer on
the island of Hawaii, but somewhere on the ocean beyond the eight
Hawaiian seas; that it would one day be recovered by a being without
hands and wearing neither mantle nor <i>maro</i>, but not until a
cocoa-tree, planted in the next full of the moon, should yield its
first fruit, to be eaten by the king.</p>
<p>So far as concerned the theft of the <i>Kiha-pu</i>, the seers of
the temple had spoken correctly. For some months a dense forest in the
mountains back of Waipio, interspersed with marshes and patches of rank
undergrowth, had been inhabited by a small band of wild-looking men,
who boldly helped themselves to the pigs, fowls and fruits of the
neighboring farmers, and held noisy festivals almost nightly within the
gloomy recesses of their mountain retreat. They were said to be only
half-human, and capable of assuming other than their natural forms.
They had occasionally visited Waipio in parties of from two to five,
and entertained the people by telling fortunes and exhibiting strange
feats of posturing and legerdemain. In the guise of an old <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>woman the chief of the band had entered the
royal mansion and stolen the <i>Kiha-pu</i>, leaving in its place the
hideous stone image mentioned; then, as if the object of their stay
near Waipio had been attained, the entire band embarked the evening of
the next day in stolen canoes for Kauai. When safely off the coast of
Hamakua the demon-chief had defiantly wound a blast from the
<i>Kiha-pu</i>, which the king had sought to drown in the tumult of the
<i>hula</i>.</p>

</div>
<p>Kiha departed gloomily from the temple. The loss of the sacred
trumpet afflicted him sorely. It had long been an heirloom in the royal
family of Hawaii, and its powers had been increased during his reign.
In obedience to the revelation of a <i>kaula</i> of great sanctity, he
had secretly deposited it in a cave near the summit of Mauna Kea and
retired to a valley below. Near the middle of the following night a
sound unearthly and terrible came echoing down the mountain-side,
followed by a hurricane which uprooted trees and tore great rocks from
their fastenings and hurled them into the gorges below. The earth
trembled as if a volcano was about to burst forth, and a ruddy light
hung about the summit. The sound ceased, the wind fell to a whisper,
and Kiha rose to his feet in the darkness and said: &ldquo;It is well.
The great Lono has kept faith. He has blown the sacred trumpet, and
henceforth it will have the voice of a god!&rdquo; The next morning he
repaired to the cave, and found the shell, not where he had left it,
but on the top of a huge rock with which the entrance had been for ever
closed. He raised the trumpet to his lips, and such sound as his heart
desired came forth at the bidding of his breath. He breathed a simple
call to his subjects, and it was heard the distance of a day&rsquo;s
journey. He gave a battle-blast, and his ears were stunned with the
mingled cries and groans of conflict. He ventured an appeal to the
unseen, and to a weird music around him rose gnomes, fairies and
grinning monsters. He returned elated to the palace, and more and more,
as its strange voices were heard, did the <i>Kiha-pu</i> become an
object of awe and wonder.</p>
<p>Although he took every possible precaution to keep from the people
all knowledge of the loss of the <i>Kiha-pu</i>, the king had little
faith in the assurances of the seers of the great temple that it would
in time be recovered. The conditions of its recovery <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>were
too vague, distant and unsatisfactory to be entitled to serious
consideration. However, within a few days, with his own hands he
planted a cocoa-tree near the door of his chamber, and had a strong
fence placed around it. He visited the spot daily and saw that the
ground was kept moist, and in due time a healthy shoot came forth to
reward his watchfulness. The members of the royal household wondered at
the interest taken by the king in a simple cocoa sprout; but when it
was intimated that he was making a new experiment in planting, his care
of the little tree ceased to attract remark.</p>
<p>And now, while the king is anxiously watching the growth of his
cocoa-tree, and carefully guarding it from accident and blight, let us
follow the travels of the <i>Kiha-pu</i>. Instead of sailing for Kauai
through the island channels, the band of demi-demons took a northwest
course, intending to reach their destination without touching at any
intermediate point. The powers of the <i>Kiha-pu</i> were known to
them, and their chief amused himself and his graceless companions by
testing its virtues. When off the coast of Maui a blast of the trumpet
brought near <i>Ukanipo</i>, a terrible shark-god, sent by
<i>Kuula</i>, the powerful but exacting god of the fishermen of that
island. On a jutting headland could be seen a <i>heiau</i> dedicated to
him and his wife, <i>Hina</i>. Hundreds of sharks followed in the train
of <i>Ukanipo</i>. They surrounded the canoes and lashed the sea into
foam. Separating, they formed a great circle around the little fleet,
and, swiftly approaching, drove a school of flying-fish across the
canoes, many striking the sails and falling into the open boats and
thus providing an opportune supply of favorite food.</p>
<p>Sighting Molokai, they thought of landing to replenish their
water-calabashes; but as the coast was rugged and the wind unfavorable,
a blast of the trumpet was blown to <i>Kuluiau</i>, the goddess of
rain. Instantly there was a commotion in the heavens. Black clouds
began to gather around them, and they had barely time to arrange their
<i>kapa</i> sheds and funnels before the rain poured down in torrents
and filled their calabashes to overflowing.</p>
<p>Believing the <i>Kiha-pu</i> would bring them anything they desired,
and returning thanks for nothing received, when off the northern coast
of Molokai, near Kaulapapa, they sounded a call to <i>Laamaomao</i>,
god of the winds, who since the days of Moikeha, more than two
centuries before, had occupied a cave on that island. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>Enraged at an appeal for favoring winds from
such a source, <i>Laamaomao</i> opened the mouth of the <i>ipu</i> in
which he kept the winds imprisoned, and turned it toward the sea. A few
minutes after a hot, fierce hurricane struck the canoes of the
miscreants, upsetting two of them and tearing their sails in tatters.
The chief had sufficient presence of mind to call through the trumpet
for <i>Maikahulipu</i>, the god who assists in righting upset canoes,
and the foundered boats were soon restored to their proper positions
and partially freed from water. But there was no abatement in the
violence of the wind. For more than a day and a night the canoes were
driven before it almost with the speed of a shark, until finally their
drenched and wearied occupants heard before them through the darkness
the sound of breakers against a rock-bound shore. The danger was
imminent, for paddles were useless. Raising the trumpet to his lips,
the chief called for <i>Uhumakaikai</i>, a powerful fish-god. No
response came, and the cliffs frowned before him as he hastily
trumpeted for <i>Apukohai</i>, another fish-god of Kauai, whose acts
were usually cruel and malicious. The spray of shattered waves against
the rocks began to wet the canoes, when they were seized by a force
unseen, <span class="corr" id="xd26e7498" title=
"Source: darwn">drawn</span> away from the cliffs, swept around a
northward point, and flung by the waves upon a sandy beach not far from
Koloa.</p>
<p>Thus escaping with their lives, the party traveled overland and
joined a band of congenial spirits in the mountains back of Waimea,
where they remained until they were driven from the island for their
misdemeanors. Leaving Kauai, they crossed the channel, and, after
moving from place to place for some years, finally took up their abode
in a secluded spot near Waolani, on the island of Oahu.</p>
<p>In the possession of the <i>Kiha-pu</i>, Ika, the chief of the band,
who claimed it as his individual property, became cruel and dictatorial
to his companions. He esteemed himself little less than a god, and
demanded a full half of all the earnings and pilferings of his
associates. As the <i>Kiha-pu</i> was the cause of this exaction, one
of the friends of Ika, not daring to destroy or purloin the shell,
resolved to despoil it of its magic powers. To this end, with great
offerings of pigs and fowls, he consulted a priest of <i>Lono</i> at
Waianae, and was told that a <i>tabu</i> mark, placed somewhere on the
shell with the approval of <i>Lono</i>, would accomplish <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>what
was desired. As the priest alone could place the mark upon the shell,
he consented to visit Waolani, and remain in the neighborhood until the
trumpet could be brought to him. Everything having been arranged, one
evening Ika, without great persuasion, was made drunk with <i>awa</i>,
when the shell was stolen and conveyed to the priest, who, with a point
of flint, hastily scratched near the outer rim a <i>pea</i> mark, or
<i>tabu</i> cross, meantime burning incense and chanting a low prayer
to <i>Lono</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can its powers be restored?&rdquo; inquired the friend of
Ika, as the <i>tabued</i> trumpet was returned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while the <i>tabu</i> mark remains,&rdquo; replied the
priest; &ldquo;not until&mdash;but no matter; its magic voices are
silent now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Ika awoke from his drunken stupor the <i>Kiha-pu</i> had been
restored to its usual place of deposit.</p>
<p>The next morning Ika partook of more <i>awa</i>, threw over his
shoulders a cape of red&mdash;a color sacred to the
gods&mdash;suspended the <i>Kiha-pu</i> from his neck with a cord of
human hair, and went proudly forth to receive the homage of his
companions. But they refused to accord him the honors to which he
imagined he was entitled, and in his wrath he raised the trumpet to his
lips to blast them with a proclamation of his superiority. A natural
and monotonous sound issued from the shell. He regarded it for a moment
with amazement, then replaced it to his lips and poured his breath into
it with the full force of his lungs; but its many voices were silent;
its thunder-tones had been hushed.</p>
<p>He hastily re-entered his hut to escape the comments of his
companions, and discovered, after repeated trials, that the
<i>Kiha-pu</i> had lost its magic powers, and in his hands was nothing
more than a simple shell. Not doubting that it had been deprived of its
virtues through supernatural agencies, Ika visited a renowned
<i>kilo</i>, or wizard, living near Waialua, taking with him the
<i>Kiha-pu</i>, which was enclosed in a pouch of <i>kapa</i>, that it
might not be observed. The age of the <i>kilo</i> was a hundred and
twenty-four years, and he was totally blind, subsisting upon the bounty
of those who sought his counsel. Finding his hut after some difficulty,
Ika presented him with a roll of <i>kapa</i> which he had brought with
him from Waolani, and a pig which he had stolen in the valley below,
and implored him to ascertain, if possible, the cause of the
disenchantment of the <i>Kiha-pu</i>. Taking the trumpet from Ika, the
<i>kilo</i> passed his wrinkled hands over it for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>some
minutes, and then retired with it behind a screen of mats, leaving his
visitor under the eye of an old crone, who had admitted him without a
word and seated herself beside the opening.</p>
<p>It was a long time before the <i>kilo</i> reappeared, and it was
then to inform Ika that little could be learned concerning the
<i>Kiha-pu</i>. He had employed every means known to his art, and
finally appealed to <i>Uli</i>, the supreme god of sorcery, when the
reluctant answer came that the <i>Kiha-pu</i> had been silenced by a
power greater than his. &ldquo;I dare not inquire further,&rdquo; said
the <i>kilo</i>, returning the trumpet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will its voices ever return to it? Will your cowardice allow
you to answer that question?&rdquo; inquired Ika, in a sneering
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the <i>kilo</i>, with an effort
restraining his wrath and speaking calmly&mdash;&ldquo;yes; its voices
will be heard again in Hawaii, among the hills that have sent back
their echoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ika would have questioned the <i>kilo</i> farther, but the old woman
rose and pointed toward the door, and with a look of disappointment he
replaced the shell in its pouch of <i>kapa</i> and sullenly left the
hut.</p>
<p>Returning to Waolani, Ika abandoned his lofty pretensions and
mingled again with his companions on terms of comparative equality.
This restored him to their friendship, and, remembering the words of
the <i>kilo</i>, he prevailed upon a majority of them to accompany him
to Hawaii. Stealing boats at Waikiki, the party set sail for Hawaii,
and the fourth day landed at Kawaihae, in the district of Kohala. There
they abandoned their canoes, or exchanged them for food, and in parties
of four or five proceeded across the island by way of Waimea, and soon
after took possession of their old quarters in the mountains back of
Waipio, after an absence of eight years.</p>
<p>In all these years what had become of the cocoa-tree planted by
Kiha, with the coming of the first-fruits of which the magic trumpet
was to be restored by a being without hands and wearing neither mantle
nor <i>maro</i>? For seven years he had watched and nurtured its
growth, staying it against wind and storm, and guarding its every leaf
and stem. It was a vigorous and shapely tree, and its leaves were above
the touch of a battle-spear in the hands of the king. But no signs of
fruit appeared, and the heart of Kiha was troubled with the thought
that the tree might be barren, and that the gods had mocked him. The
seventh year of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259"
name="pb259">259</a>]</span>its growth had come and was going, when one
morning he descried among its branches three young cocoanuts, scarcely
less in size than his clenched fist. He thought it strange that he had
not seen them before, and then wondered that he had seen them at all,
for they were closely hidden among the leaves. But there they were, to
his great joy, and he watched them day by day until they attained an
age and size at which they might be eaten. He then sent for the
high-priest, and, pointing to the fruit, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold the fruit of the tree planted by the hands of Kiha. At
the rising of the sun to-morrow I shall eat of it. Will the gods fulfil
their promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O chief!&rdquo; replied the priest, &ldquo;I do not see the
means; but you planted the tree; the fruit is fit for food; eat of it
to-morrow, if you will. The gods are all-powerful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At daylight the next morning the fruit was taken from the tree, and
the king drank the milk of the three cocoanuts, and ate of the meat of
all, first giving thanks to the gods. He then threw himself upon his
<i>kapa-moe</i> until the sun was well up in the heavens, when he rose
and went forth to meet his chief adviser, as was his daily custom, and
learn from his spies and other confidential officers what of importance
had transpired since the day before. The only information that seemed
to interest him was that a lawless band of strange men&mdash;apparently
the same who infested the neighborhood some years before&mdash;had
reoccupied the marshy forest in the mountains back of Waipio, and would
doubtless become a scourge to the planters in the upper part of the
valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was through such a band that I was robbed of the
<i>Kiha-pu</i>,&rdquo; thought the king. &ldquo;It may be that the very
same have returned and brought back with them the sacred trumpet. The
ways of the gods are mysterious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Communicating the thought to no one, Kiha despatched a discreet
messenger to reconnoitre the camp of the marauders, and in the
afternoon secretly visited the temple of <i>Paakalani</i>, where he
learned through the <i>kaulas</i> that the <i>Kiha-pu</i> was somewhere
on the island of Hawaii.</p>
<p>The sun was sinking in the west when the messenger returned, with
the information that the chief of the demon band was Ika, who, with
many of his followers, had been seen in and around Waipio many years
before. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span></p>
<p>These tidings had scarcely reached the ears of the king when a
tumult was discovered at the main gate of the palace enclosure, and a
few minutes after an old man, with his arms bound behind his back, and
followed by a strange-looking dog, was being dragged by a crowd of
officers and others toward the royal mansion, in front of which Kiha
was sitting, surrounded by a number of distinguished chiefs and titled
retainers. The man was well advanced in years, and was clad in a
<i>maro</i> and <i>kihei</i>, or short mantle of <i>kapa</i>, while
from his neck was suspended an ivory charm rudely carved into the form
of a dog&rsquo;s foot. He was above the average height, and around his
stooped shoulders hung a tangled mass of grizzled hair. His beard was
unshorn, and from beneath his shaggy brows peered a pair of small and
malignant-looking eyes. He glowered savagely at his captors, and
resented anything that seemed like unnecessary force in urging him
along. The dog was a large, misshapen brute, with human-looking ears
and a bluish coat of bristling hair. It had a long, swinish tail, and
one of its eyes was white and the other green. The animal followed
closely and sullenly at its master&rsquo;s heels, uttering an
occasional low growl when too roughly jostled by the crowd.</p>
<p>When within a hundred paces of the mansion the officers halted with
their prisoner, and an attendant was despatched by the king to
ascertain the cause of the excitement. Learning that the officers were
desirous of bringing before him a man suspected of pilfering from the
royal estates, the king consented to listen to the accusation in
person, and ordered the prisoner to appear in his presence.
Approaching, the old man prostrated himself at the feet of Kiha, and
the dog, giving voice to a dismal howl, crouched upon the earth, laid
his nose between his paws, and bent his green eye upon the king. Kiha
regarded both for a moment with an amused expression; but there was
something demoniac in the appearance of the dog, and after catching a
glimpse of it he could scarcely remove his gaze from the green eye that
glared upon him.</p>
<p>Commanding one of the officers to speak for himself and the rest,
that the matter might be briefly determined, the king was informed that
the prisoner was a native of the island of Kauai, and some months
before had landed with his dog in the district of Kau; that he was an
awa thief and had trained his fiendish-looking <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>dog
to do his pilfering; that the animal possessed the intelligence of a
<i>kahuna</i> and the instincts of a demon, and could almost steal the
mantle from a man&rsquo;s shoulders without detection; that the
prisoner had been driven for his thefts from Kau to Kona, and thence to
Hamakua; that he had been living for some months past at Kikaha, where
his dog, <i>Puapua-lenalena</i>, as he was called, had become noted for
his thefts; that <i>awa</i> had been missed by the <i>luna</i> of one
of the king&rsquo;s estates in the upper part of the valley; that the
night before a watch had been placed, and the demon dog had been
detected in the act of leaving the royal plantation with a quantity of
<i>awa</i> in his mouth; that the animal had been followed to the hut
of his master, who was found asleep under the influence of <i>awa</i>,
which the dog had doubtless ground with his teeth into an intoxicating
drink, since on being aroused the man denied that he had either stolen
or chewed it; and, finally, after some resistance, the prisoner had
been brought to Waipio, followed by his dog, and was now before the
king for examination and sentence.</p>
<p>After the officer had concluded his account of the misdemeanors of
the prisoner, by permission of the king the old man rose to his feet,
and was about to speak in his own defence when Kiha, turning his gaze
with an effort from the green eye of the dog, abruptly inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What manner of animal is this, and how came he in your
possession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O king!&rdquo; replied the prisoner, &ldquo;the dog was given
to me by my uncle, a distinguished <i>kaula</i> of Kauai, and it is
believed that he was cast up from the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; exclaimed the king, with a gesture of
impatience. &ldquo;Take them both to the temple of
<i>Paakalani</i>,&rdquo; he continued, addressing a chief with a yellow
cape and helmet, &ldquo;and there await my coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoner and his green-eyed companion were removed to the
temple, and in the dusk of the evening Kiha proceeded thither alone.
Entering the royal retreat with which the <i>heiau</i> enclosure was
provided, he sent for the high-priest, and soon after for the prisoner
and his dog. They were conducted to the apartment, and the door was
closed, a <i>kukui</i> torch held at another opening throwing a glare
of light into the room.</p>
<p>The king sat for a few breaths in silence, while the priest was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>scanning the prisoner and his strange companion.
Finally, pointing to the dog, Kiha turned to the priest and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderful animal&mdash;a being without hands, and wearing
neither mantle nor <i>maro</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; returned the priest, recalling the promise of
the gods; &ldquo;and should he be the messenger, his services must not
be slighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the king, addressing the prisoner.
&ldquo;I have faith that this animal can do me a service. In a marshy
forest in the mountains back of Waipio a band of conjuring outlaws have
lately found a retreat. A magic shell of great power, stolen from me
many years ago, is now in the possession of some one of
them&mdash;probably of Ika, their chief. Can you prompt this animal to
recover the <i>Kiha-pu</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replied the prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do so,&rdquo; returned the king, &ldquo;and I will not
only give you the life you have forfeited, but will see that you are
provided henceforth with all the <i>awa</i> you have an appetite to
consume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words of the king the dog rose to his feet, uttered a
growling sound which seemed to be half-human, and approached the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No instructions are required,&rdquo; said the old man;
&ldquo;he understands, and is ready to start upon his
errand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then send him forth at once,&rdquo; returned the king;
&ldquo;the night is dark and will favor him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was opened, and like a flash the dog sprang from the room,
leaped the closed gate of the outer wall, and in the darkness dashed up
the valley toward the mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will await his return here,&rdquo; said the king, looking
inquiringly toward the prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be back a little beyond the middle of the
night,&rdquo; replied the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the <i>Kiha-pu</i>?&rdquo; inquired the king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either with or without it,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>Leaving the prisoner in the custody of the high-priest and his
attendants, Kiha walked out into the starlight. His face was feverish,
and the kiss of the trade-winds was cool. The <i>heiau</i> of
<i>Paakalani</i> was a <i>puhonua</i>, or sacred place of
refuge&mdash;one of the two on the island of Hawaii&mdash;and he
wondered whether, under any circumstances, he could properly demand the
life of the prisoner <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263"
name="pb263">263</a>]</span>were he to claim the protection of the
temple. Had he voluntarily sought refuge in the <i>puhonua</i>, there
would have been no doubt; but as he was forcibly taken there by royal
order, his right to exemption from seizure was a question of doubt.</p>
<p>Dismissing the subject with the reflection that the life or death of
the prisoner was of little consequence, Kiha strolled toward the inner
temple and reverently bowed before an image of <i>Lono</i> near the
entrance. Remains of recent sacrifices still smelt rank upon the altar,
and scores of gods of almost every grade and function looked grimly
down upon him from the walls. Dim lights were seen in some of the
quarters of the priests constructed against the outer wall of the
enclosure, and a torch was burning at the main entrance.</p>
<p>As the evening wore on the silence of the <i>heiau</i> was broken
only by the hooting of the sacred owls from the walls of the inner
temple, and Kiha threw himself at the foot of a pepper-tree, and was
soon wafted out into the boundless sea of dreams.</p>
<p>After leaping the gate of the <i>heiau</i> the dog started up the
valley with the speed of the wind. As he swept past the thatched huts
in his course, those who caught sight of him for an instant were sure
that they beheld a demon, and the dogs that pursued speedily returned,
to crouch whiningly behind their masters.</p>
<p>Reaching the upper end of the valley, the dog followed an ascending
trail through a steep ravine coming down from the northward, and in a
short time, considering the distance traveled, stood snuffing the air
at the verge of the forest within which the outlaws had found a
temporary refuge. Distant lights were seen flickering through
occasional openings among the trees and tangled undergrowth, and at
intervals strange voices, as if of song and merriment, were heard.</p>
<p>For some time the dog remained motionless, and then stealthily crept
into the forest. What form he assumed, how he learned of the
hiding-place of the <i>Kiha-pu</i>, and through what means he escaped
discovery, are details which tradition has left to conjecture. It is
told only that he succeeded in finding in the unguarded hut of Ika,
seizing in his mouth, and escaping undiscovered from the forest with,
the sacred trumpet.</p>
<p>So adroitly had the theft been committed that it seemed that the dog
would surely escape without detection; but in plunging down the steep
ravine through which he had finally ascended to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>the
forest, he dropped the <i>Kiha-pu</i>, breaking from the rim a piece
embracing the small <i>pea</i> or <i>tabu</i> mark of silence placed
upon it by the <i>kaula</i> of Waianae. In an instant the liberated
voices of the trumpet poured forth in a blast which echoed through the
hills and started the night-birds to screaming.</p>
<p>The sound was heard by the reveling demi-demons of the forest, and,
ascertaining that the shell had been stolen, they poured down the
mountain-side in pursuit of the plunderer. Their speed was something
more than human, and the darkness did not seem to impede their steps.
From time to time the voice of the trumpet came back to them; but it
grew fainter and fainter in the distance, until they finally abandoned
the chase as hopeless, Ika himself suggesting that the <i>Kiha-pu</i>,
with its voices in some manner restored to it, had taken wings and
escaped.</p>
<p>The king slept under the pepper-tree until past the middle of the
night, when the hooting of an owl almost at his ear awoke him, and he
rose and re-entered the royal retreat, where he found the high-priest
with a number of his attendants, and the prisoner intently listening at
the half-open door.</p>
<p>Kiha was about to inquire the time of the night&mdash;for he had
neglected to look at the stars before entering&mdash;when a noise was
heard at the outer gate. The prisoner stepped forward and threw back
the door, and the next moment the dog sprang into the room, laid the
<i>Kiha-pu</i> at the feet of the king, and then dropped dead beside
it.</p>
<p>The overjoyed king raised and placed the trumpet to his lips, and
with a swelling heart roused the people of Waipio with a blast such as
they had not heard for more than eight years. Liberating the prisoner,
who was grief-stricken at the death of his dog, Kiha ordered that he
henceforth be fed from the royal table.</p>
<p>Winding another blast upon the trumpet, the king returned to the
palace, around which were congregated hundreds of excited people. Among
them were chiefs in yellow capes and helmets, and warriors armed with
spear and battle-axe. Summoning his <i>alii-koa</i>, or principal
military leader, a brief council was held, followed by the sending
forth of the plumed aids of the king, and the speedy concentration
within the palace grounds of a picked body of three or four hundred
warriors armed with short javelins and knives for close encounter.</p>
<p>The little army moved rapidly but noiselessly up the valley,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>and at early daylight surrounded and attacked
the camp of the demon band. A desperate hand-to-hand conflict ensued;
but the miscreants were overpowered, and all slain with the exception
of Ika and two others, who were reserved alive for the altar.</p>
<p>On the evening following, in the midst of great rejoicing, the
<i>Kiha-pu</i> was rededicated to <i>Lono</i>, and Ika and his
companions were slain without the walls and sacrificed, with a host of
other offerings, in the temple of <i>Paakalani</i>.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The reign of Liloa was as peaceful as that of Kiha,
his distinguished father. He did not lack ability, either as a civil or
military leader, however his pleasant and mirthful ways may have
impressed to the contrary. He was fond of good living, fine apparel and
comely women; yet he held the sceptre firmly, and was prompt to punish
wrong-doing in his chiefs or infringement of any of his prerogatives.
Nevertheless, his heart was kind, and he frequently forgave the humble
who had crossed his shadow, and the thoughtless who had violated the
spirit of a royal <i>tabu</i>.</p>
<p>As he was distracted neither by domestic disturbance nor wars with
neighboring kings, Liloa made frequent visits to the several districts
of the island, sometimes with an imposing retinue of chiefs and
retainers, but quite as often with no more than two or three trusty
attendants. Sometimes he traveled <i>incognito</i>, visiting suspected
district chiefs to observe their methods of government, and, when
occasion for rebuke occurred, to their great confusion making himself
known to them.</p>
<p>Near the close of the year 1460, before the annual festival of
<i>Lono</i>, which inaugurated the beginning of a new year, Liloa went
with a large and brilliant party, in gaily-decked double canoes
carrying the royal colors, from Waipio to Koholalele, in Hamakua, to
assist in the reconsecration of the old temple of <i>Manini</i>, the
restoration and enlargement of which had just been completed. He took
with him his high-priest, Laeanui, a band of musicians and dancers, and
his chief navigator and astrologer, and the <i>heiau</i> was
consecrated with unusual display. Laeanui recited the
<i>kuawili</i>&mdash;the long prayer of consecration&mdash;and
twenty-four human victims were laid upon the altar.</p>
<p>Ordering the party to return in the double canoes without
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>him, Liloa resolved to make the journey overland
to Waipio with a single attendant; and it is quite probable that it was
something more than accident that prompted the royal traveler to
deviate from the shortest path to Waipio, and tarry for some hours in a
pleasant grove of palms near Kealakaha, where dwelt with her old father
one of the most beautiful maidens in all Hamakua.</p>
<p>The name of the girl was Akahia-kuleana. She was tall and slender,
and her dark hair, which rippled down in wavelets, shrouded her bare
shoulders like a veil. Her eyes were soft, and her voice was like the
music of a mountain rivulet, and when her bosom was bedecked with
<i>leis</i> of fragrant blossoms it seemed that they must have grown
there, so much did she appear to be a part of them.</p>
<p>Although in humble life, Akahia was really of royal blood, since six
generations back her paternal ancestor was Kalahuamoku, a half-brother
to Kalapana, from whom Liloa drew his strain. She knew the rank of her
royal visitor, and felt honored that he should praise her beauty; and
when he kissed her lips at parting he left with her his <i>maro</i> and
the ivory clasp of his necklace, at the same time whispering words in
her ear which in a generation later transferred the sceptre of Hawaii
from the direct line to humbler but worthier hands.</p>
<p>Before the trade-winds came and went again the gentle Akahia,
unwedded, became a mother. At first her father frowned upon the child;
but it was a strong and healthy boy, who looked as if he might some day
wield with uncommon vigor a <i>laau-palau</i> if not a battle-axe, and
he soon became reconciled to the presence of the little intruder. In
those days, it is proper to mention, such events occasioned but little
comment, and entailed upon the mother neither social ostracism nor
especial reproach.</p>
<p>The child was named Umi, and, to give it a stronger protector than
herself, Akahia became the wife of her cousin Maakao, a strong, rough
man, who had always shown great affection for her, and who felt honored
in becoming the husband of one who might have taken her choice among
many.</p>
<p>The father of Akahia cultivated a <i>kalo</i> patch larger than his
necessities really required, and was abundantly supplied with pigs,
poultry, yams, bananas, cocoanuts and breadfruit, which he was at all
times enabled to exchange for fish, crabs, limpets and other products
of the sea. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span></p>
<p>All land titles at that time vested either in the sovereign or the
chiefs subject to him, and the producer was frequently required to
return to his landlord a full third or half of all his labor yielded.
Sometimes the land-owner was more liberal with his tenants; but quite
as often he took to the extent of his need or greed, with no one to
challenge the injustice of his demands.</p>
<p>But the bit of land occupied by the father of Akahia was part of a
large tract reserved for the benefit of the king, and because of the
<i>alii</i> blood with which he was credited, but of which he made no
boast, the rent he returned was merely nominal.</p>
<p>When Umi was about ten years of age the father of Akahia died,
leaving his little estate to his daughter. She had two brothers living,
both older than herself. But the cultivation of the soil was not
congenial to them, and, as there had been no wars of moment in Hawaii
for nearly two generations, one of them, who had been a dreamer from
his youth, had been inducted into the service of the gods by the
high-priest Laeanui, to whom Liloa had given in perpetuity the
possession of Kekaha, in the district of Kona, and was otherwise
influential; while the second brother, on reaching manhood, had gone
with spear and sling to Maui, and risen to distinction in the military
service of the <i>moi</i> of that island.</p>
<p>So Akahia and her husband continued to occupy unmolested the old
plantation. But the agents who collected the revenues of the king were
less liberal with Maakao than they had been with the father of his
wife, and he was compelled to make the same rent returns as other royal
tenants. Nor this alone. A portion of their land had been given to
another, embracing a little grove of <i>hawane</i> or cocoa-trees, some
of which, it was averred, had been planted by the stewards of Pili
nearly four centuries before, and their depleted stocks of pigs and
fowls ceased to be the envy of their neighbors.</p>
<p>This harsh dealing with Akahia and her husband, it is needless to
say, was done without the knowledge of the king; but they feared to
complain, lest they might be despoiled of the little left them, and
deemed it prudent to suffer in silence rather than arouse the wrath of
an agent of whose powers they knew not the extent.</p>
<p>There were other little mouths to feed besides Umi&rsquo;s, and, as
the years came and went with their scant harvests, Maakao became
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>more and more discontented; but, with a hope in
her heart of which Maakao knew nothing, Akahia toiled on without
complaint. Year by year she saw Umi developing into manhood, and noted
that in thought, habit and bearing he was different from others.</p>
<p>Umi loved his mother and was not unkind to Maakao; but he spent much
of his time by the sea-shore where the great waves thundered against
the cliffs, and in the hills where, among the <i>ohia</i> and sandal
trees, the trade-winds whispered to him of the unknown. He would climb
to the crown of the tallest cocoa-tree because there was danger in it,
and buffet the fiercest waves in his frail canoe; but neither threat
nor persuasion could ever induce him to delve in the slime of the
<i>kalo</i> patch or plant a row of yams. He would bring fish from the
sea and fruits from the mountains, but could not be prevailed upon to
till the soil. He fashioned spears of cunning workmanship, and from the
teeth of sharks made knives of double edge, but to the implements of
husbandry he gave but little note.</p>
<p>At the age of sixteen Umi had reached almost the proportions of a
man. His limbs were strong, his features manly and handsome, his eyes
clear and full of expression, and in athletic sports and the use of
arms he had no equal among his companions. His habits brought around
him but few friends, yet his kindness to all left no pretext for
enmity; and while some said he absented himself from home in a spirit
of idleness, others shook their heads and ventured the opinion that he
visited the recesses of the wooded hills alone to converse with the
<i>kini-akua</i> and learn wisdom from the gods. And his strange
conduct, it may well be imagined, was made the subject of frequent
discussion in the neighborhood, for Maakao complained continually of
his idleness, and but for the intercessions of the mother, who alone
was able to account for his peculiarities, would have closed his doors
against him.</p>
<p>But Umi had a few friends to extol his goodness and defend him
against unkind insinuation, and among them were Piimaiwaa and
Omaukamau, youths of about his own age, and Kulamea, the younger and
only sister of the latter. From childhood these friends had been his
frequent companions, and as he grew to manhood, strong-limbed, resolute
and gentle, they learned to regard him with a love prepared for any
sacrifice. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span></p>
<p>Kulamea was a bright-eyed, dusky little fairy, who often accompanied
Umi and her brother in their rambles. They petted her until she became
an exacting little tyrant, and then Umi, at her command, made toys for
her, climbed the tallest cocoa-trees, and scaled the steepest cliffs in
search of flowers and berries that she liked; and, in return for these
kindnesses, what, at the age of fifteen, could Kulamea do but love
almost to idolatry the brave and gentle companion who had developed
into a splendid manhood? And what could Umi do at twenty but return in
kind the devotion of one now ripening into a charming womanhood, whose
childish friendship was the brightest sunshine that had ever flecked
the landscape of his dreamy life?</p>
<p>With a feeling of uneasiness Akahia watched Umi&rsquo;s growing love
for Kulamea, and when at twenty he would have married her, much to the
gratification of Maakao, she kindly but firmly said to her son:
&ldquo;Be not in haste to fetter your free limbs. Be patient, as I have
been for twenty years. Kulamea is worthy&mdash;but wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why wait?&rdquo; exclaimed Maakao, suddenly appearing. He had
been listening without the door. &ldquo;Why should he wait?&rdquo; he
continued; &ldquo;he has all his life been idle, and it is time that he
should have a house of his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have spoken well!&rdquo; replied Umi, drawing himself up
to his full height, and looking scornfully down upon the husband of his
mother&mdash;&ldquo;you have spoken well, Maakao! It is time, indeed,
that I stopped this dreaming! I will never eat food again under your
roof. Now get you to your <i>kalo</i> patch; you will find occupation
there befitting you! I will seek other means of living!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these scornful words Umi strode haughtily from the house.
Enraged at the insult, Maakao seized a <i>laau-palau</i>, or large
<i>kalo</i>-knife, and sprang after him. Umi turned and reached for his
<i>pahoa</i>. Maakao raised his weapon to strike, but it dropped to the
earth as if a paralysis had seized his arm as Akahia sprang before him,
exclaiming: &ldquo;Do not dare to strike! He is not your son; he is
your chief! Down on your knees before him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the dismay of Maakao and profound astonishment of Umi, Akahia
then revealed the secret of Umi&rsquo;s birth, and, taking from their
hiding-place the keepsakes left with her by Liloa, said, as she handed
them to her son: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270"
name="pb270">270</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father is king of Hawaii. Go to him in person and place
these mementoes before him. Tell him Akahia-kuleana returns them to him
by the hands of his and her son, who is worthy of him, and he will own
you to be the child of his love. He is noble and will hold sacred his
royal pledge. This should have been done long ago, but I could not
bring my heart to part with you. Go, and may the gods be your
protection and your guide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strange revelation was soon known throughout the neighborhood,
and Umi prepared for his journey to Waipio. How should he appear before
Liloa, whose will was law and whose frown was death? In what guise
should he seek the presence of his royal father?</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an <i>alii-kapu</i>!&rdquo; answered Akahia, proudly. Then
from an <i>ipu</i> she brought forth a plumed helmet and cape of the
feathers of the <i>oo</i>, which she had secretly fabricated with her
own hands, and placed them upon the head and shoulders of her son.</p>
<p>To Kulamea alone was the news of what had befallen Umi unwelcome.
She would have been more than content to share with him the common lot;
but now that he was about to be recognized as the son of the great
Liloa, she felt that they were soon to part for ever. Other alliances
would be found for him, and he would forget the humble playmate of his
youth, who loved him, not because his father was a king, but because
they had grown up together and neither of them could help it. So when,
two days after, Umi started overland for Waipio, accompanied by his two
trusty friends, Piimaiwaa and Omaukamau, Kulamea secreted herself to
avoid the agony of a parting farewell from Umi; but he found her,
nevertheless, and made her happy by kissing and telling her that,
whatever might be his future, she should share it; and she believed
him, for he had never deceived her.</p>
<p>Umi and his companions arrived in Waipio valley at nightfall. There
they remained during the night, and the next morning crossed the little
stream of Wailoa, near which was the royal mansion. There Umi left his
companions and proceeded alone to the palace enclosure. His head was
adorned with a helmet surmounted with white and scarlet plumes, and
from his broad shoulders hung a cape of yellow feathers, such as an
<i>alii</i> alone was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href=
"#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>permitted to wear, while around
his loins was fastened the <i>maro</i> left with Akahia by the king,
and the ivory clasp ornamented a necklace of rare and beautiful shells.
In his hand he bore an <i>ihe</i>, or javelin, of unusual weight and
exquisite finish, and many eyes followed him as he approached the
palace; for, although a stranger, it was manifest from his dress and
bearing that he did not belong to the <i>makaainana</i>, or common
people.</p>
<p>His mother had instructed him to seek the presence of the king in
the most direct manner that occasion presented, and without asking the
permission or assistance of any one, fearing, no doubt, that, to gain
admission to the royal <i>hale</i>, he might exhibit and in some manner
lose possession of the sole evidences of his paternity, and thus
receive the punishment of an impostor. He therefore passed by, without
seeking to enter, the gate of the enclosure, around which were lounging
a score or more of sentinels and retainers, and, proceeding to the rear
of the mansion, leaped over the high wall immediately back and within a
hundred paces of the private apartments of the king.</p>
<p>Having thus violated a rule of royal etiquette, the penalty of which
was death, unless mitigated by satisfactory explanation, Umi grasped
his <i>ihe</i> firmly, determined, should he be opposed, to fight his
way to the royal presence. It was a desperate resolution, but he had
faith in himself, and was without fear.</p>
<p>His movements had been watched as he passed the gate of the
enclosure without a word, and as he sprang over the wall he found a
number of uplifted spears between him and the entrances to the mansion.
Nerving himself for the worst, he strode past the interposing weapons,
strongly hurling their points aside when too closely presented, and in
a moment stood at the back entrance of the palace, through which no one
but of the royal household was permitted to enter.</p>
<p>This audacity saved him from more determined opposition, since it
seemed incredible that any one not possessing the confidence of the
king would take such double hazard of his life. Stepping within the
entrance, Umi turned, and, with a half-amused smile at the baffled
guard now clamoring around the door, struck the handle of his javelin
firmly into the ground, and walked unarmed into the presence of the
king.</p>
<p>As Umi entered unannounced, the king had just finished his morning
repast, and was lounging on a couch of many folds of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span><i>kapa</i>, unattended except by his
spittoon-bearer and two half-grown boys with <i>kahilis</i>.</p>
<p>Astounded at the intrusion, the king rose to a sitting posture, and,
with a frown upon his face, was about to speak, when Umi stepped to the
couch and boldly seated himself in the lap of Liloa.</p>
<p>Although past sixty, the king still retained a goodly share of his
earlier vigor, and, throwing Umi from his knees, angrily exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Audacious slave! how dare you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Umi rose to his feet, and, standing proudly before the king with
folded arms, replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The son of Liloa dare do anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the king did not speak. He looked into the face of the
undaunted young stranger, and noted that it was noble; and then his
thoughts went back to Kealakaha, and to the fair young girl of better
than common blood whom he had met there many years before while
journeying to Waipio after consecrating the temple of <i>Manini</i>,
and finally, almost as in a dream, to the pledge he had given and the
tokens he had left with her. When all this came back to him he cast his
eyes over the comely youth, and beheld his <i>maro</i> around the loins
of Umi, and the ivory clasp of his necklace upon his breast. He could
scarcely doubt, yet, as if he had recollected nothing, seen nothing, he
calmly but kindly said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man, you claim to be my son. If so, tell me of your
mother, and of the errand that brings you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Umi bowed and answered: &ldquo;My mother, O king, is Akahia-kuleana,
of Kealakaha, and my years were twenty at the last ripening of the
<i>ohias</i>. For the first time, four days ago, she told me I was the
son of the king of Hawaii, and to take to him this <i>maro</i> and this
ivory clasp, and he would not disown me. You are Liloa, the honored
sovereign of Hawaii. I am Umi, the humble son of Akahia-kuleana. From
the hands of my mother I have brought to you this <i>maro</i> and this
ornament of bone. If I am your son, seat me beside you on the
<i>kapa</i>; if not, order my body to the <i>heiau</i> as a sacrifice
to the gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a struggle in the breast of the king, and his eyes were
bent upon the bold youth with an expression of pride and tenderness as
he said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you gain admission here alone and
unannounced?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By leaping over the wall of the <i>pahale</i> and beating
down the spears of your guards,&rdquo; replied Umi modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a dangerous undertaking,&rdquo; suggested the king,
feigning a frown which wrinkled into a smile upon his lips; &ldquo;had
you no fear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am still young and have not yet learned to fear,&rdquo;
returned Umi, with an air of self-reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such words could come alone from a heart ennobled by the
blood of Pilikaeae! You are indeed the son of Liloa!&rdquo; exclaimed
the king, with emotion, stretching forth his hand and seating Umi
beside him. &ldquo;Not these tokens alone but your face and bearing
show it.&rdquo; And he put his arms around the neck of his son and
kissed him, and ordered a repast, which they ate together, while Umi
related to his royal father the simple events of his humble life.</p>
<p>As the strange entrance of Umi into the royal mansion had attracted
much attention, many of the privileged retainers and officers of the
court soon gathered in and around the palace; and the rank and possible
purposes of the visitor were undergoing an earnest
discussion&mdash;especially after it was learned that he was
breakfasting with the king&mdash;when Hakau, the only recognized son of
Liloa and heir-presumptive to the throne, suddenly appeared and sought
the presence of his royal father.</p>
<p>There was a dark scowl on the face of Hakau on entering the room and
observing a stranger in close conversation with the king and eating
from the same vessels, nor did it disappear when Liloa presented Umi to
him as his own son and Hakau&rsquo;s half-brother. Umi rose and frankly
offered his brother the hand of friendship and affection; but the grasp
and recognition of Hakau were cold, and when he was invited to sit down
and partake of meat with his newly-found brother he excused himself
with the falsehood that he had just risen from his morning meal. After
a few words with the king, during which he closely scrutinized
Umi&rsquo;s handsome face and manly form, Hakau withdrew, leaving no
token in word or look of any feeling of joy at the meeting.</p>
<p>Although the kings of the Hawaiian group at that time usually had
from two to six wives&mdash;either marriages of the heart or alliances
with the families of neighboring kings to strengthen their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>dynasties&mdash;tradition has given to Liloa but
one recognized wife. She was Pinea, a Maui chiefess of family
distinction, who gave to Liloa a son and one daughter&mdash;Hakau and
Kapukini. Hakau had reached his thirtieth year and had married the
daughter of the chief and high-priest Pae. They had one child, a
daughter, who had been given the name of her grandmother, Pinea.
Kapukini had not quite reached womanhood, and was the idol of the
court.</p>
<p>Hakau was a large, well-visaged man, but was haughty, selfish and
cruel. Having been, until the sudden appearance of Umi at the court,
the only recognized son of Liloa, his caprices had been humored until
his heartlessness and tyranny had become almost a by-word in Hamakua.
But the truth seems to be that he was naturally vicious and barbarous,
and tradition speaks of no greater tyrant among all the rulers of
Hawaii. Heedless of the rights of property, without return he took from
others whatever he coveted, and in an insanity of pride and criminal
envy caused to be secretly slain or disfigured such as were reputed to
surpass him in personal beauty. Without giving note or credence to the
many tales of barbarism with which tradition has connected his name, it
is doubtless true that his cruelty and contempt for the rights of his
subjects rendered him an unfit successor of the gentle and sagacious
Liloa, under whose reign the humblest were protected, and peace and
prosperity prevailed throughout the six districts of the island.</p>
<p>No further explanation of Hakau&rsquo;s freezing reception of Umi is
required. He was envious of his handsome face and noble bearing, and
hated him because of the love with which his father manifestly regarded
him. But Hakau&rsquo;s feelings in the matter were not consulted, and
the day following Umi was conducted to the temple of <i>Paakalani</i>
in great pomp, where, to the solemn music of chant and sacred drum, the
officiating priest with the newly-found son of the king went through
the form of <i>oki-ka-piko</i>&mdash;a ceremony attending the birth of
the children of royalty&mdash;and Umi was formally and publicly
recognized as his son by the king of Hawaii.</p>
<p>Hakau was compelled, with great bitterness of heart, to witness this
ceremony, but was too discreet to openly manifest his displeasure.
Returning to the palace, Umi was formally presented to the royal
household, and heralds proclaimed his rank and investiture of the
<i>tabus</i> to which he was entitled. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span></p>
<p>Although the mother of Hakau, Pinea received him kindly, and
Kapukini was more than delighted with her new and handsome brother. She
clung to his hand, and artlessly declared that Hakau was cross with her
and that she had prayed to the gods to send her another brother, just
such a one as Umi, and they had done so.</p>
<p>Soon after a great feast was given by the king in honor of the new
heir, and all the leading chiefs in the kingdom were invited to come
and pay their respects to him. Twelve hundred chiefs were present, and
the feasting and rejoicing continued for three days, interspersed with
games and athletic sports, in which Umi shone with great splendor. In
feats of strength and the skilful handling of arms he had few equals in
all that great and distinguished gathering, and in conversations with
the old he exhibited so much wisdom and prudence of speech that they
wondered who had been his tutors; and when they learned that he had
been taught by no one and that the greater part of his young life had
been passed in solitude, some of them thought the gods must have
instructed him, and all admitted that he was a worthy son of Liloa and
an honor to the royal line.</p>
<p>Umi was thus firmly established at the court of his royal father,
and adequate revenues were set apart for his proper maintenance and
that of a retinue befitting his high rank. His friends Piimaiwaa and
Omaukamau, who were overjoyed at his good fortune, entered his service
as his personal and confidential friends, and thenceforth became
identified with his career, always appearing as the most faithful and
self-sacrificing of his adherents.</p>
<p>In a week after his arrival at Waipio, Umi sent Omaukamau back to
their old home with news of his recognition by the king. He also bore
an order enlarging the area of Maakao and Akahia&rsquo;s possessions,
and relieving them from rent and all other tenant charges. Nor did he
forget Kulamea. He sent her a little present in token of his love, and
word that, although it could not safely be so then, some day in the
future she should be nearer to him, even though he might become the
king of Hawaii. The token was dear to her, and dearer still his words,
for she knew the heart of Umi and did not doubt; and thenceforth she
lived and patiently waited for him, keeping her own secret, and firmly
saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the many who sought her in marriage.</p>
<p>Umi&rsquo;s affability and intelligence soon made him a great
favorite <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>at the court and steadily endeared him to his
father. But in proportion as he grew in the favor of others
Hakau&rsquo;s hatred for him increased, and but for the fear of his
father would have manifested itself in open hostility; but Liloa, who
was growing old and feeble through a cureless malady, had not yet
designated his successor, and Hakau deemed it prudent to make no
outward showing of the intense envy and dislike of his brother which he
was secretly nursing, and which he resolved should be gratified when
the reins of government passed into his hands.</p>
<p>In a little less than two years after the recognition of Umi the
black <i>kapa</i> covered Liloa. When he felt the end approaching he
called his two sons before him, and publicly gave the charge of the
government and title of <i>moi</i> to Hakau, and the custody of the
gods and temples to Umi. &ldquo;You are to be the ruler of
Hawaii,&rdquo; he said to Hakau, &ldquo;and Umi is to be your
counselor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was grief all over the kingdom when the death of Liloa became
known, for he was greatly beloved; and, that his bones might never be
desecrated, the high-priest Pae, whose daughter Hakau had married,
secretly conveyed them to the Kona coast, and consigned them to the
deep waters off Kekaha.</p>
<p>This was in accordance with the custom of the time&mdash;in fact,
with the custom of earlier and later years, for the resting-place of
the bones of Kamehameha I., who died in 1819, is unknown. A story
survives that the remains of this eminent chief were entombed in the
sea, but the more popular belief is that they were secretly conveyed to
a cave or other place prepared for them in the hills back of Kailua, on
the island of Hawaii, and there hidden for ever from mortal gaze. In
connection with this belief it is stated that just before daylight on
the morning following the night of the death of Kamehameha, one of his
nearest friends, while the guard had been removed to afford the
opportunity, took the bones of his beloved chief upon his shoulders,
and, alone and unseen, conveyed them to their secret sepulchre.
Returning, he encountered two natives who were preparing for the labors
of the day. Fearing that he had been followed, he inquired whether they
had observed any one passing toward the hills that morning. They
declared that they had seen no one. Had they answered differently he
would have slain them both on the spot, that their secret might have
died with them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277"
name="pb277">277</a>]</span></p>
<p>The name of this chief was Hoolulu. He has been dead for many years;
and although he left children, to one of whom the secret may have been
imparted, in accordance with native custom in such matters, it is now
believed that all knowledge of the depository of the remains of the
first Kamehameha is lost. In 1853, when the necessity of hiding the
bones of distinguished chiefs was no longer recognized, Kamehameha III.
visited Kailua and almost prevailed upon Hoolulu to point out the spot.
They even started toward the hills for that purpose, but, as quite a
number of persons were observed to be following, Hoolulu declined to
proceed, and could never after be induced to divulge anything.</p>
<p>So fearful were the ancient chiefs of Hawaii that some indignity
might be offered to their remains after death&mdash;for instance, that
charmed fish-hooks or arrow-points for shooting mice might be made from
their bones&mdash;that they were invariably hidden by their surviving
friends, sometimes in the depths of the ocean, and quite as frequently,
perhaps, in the dark recesses of volcanic caverns, with which the
islands abound.</p>
<p>Immediately after Kamehameha I. had breathed his last his friend
Kalaimoku assembled the principal chiefs around the body to consider
what should be done with it. In his great admiration for the dead chief
one of them solemnly said: &ldquo;This is my thought: we will eat him
raw!&rdquo; But the body was left to Liholiho, son and successor of the
dead king who, with his queen, Kamamalu, died while on a visit to
England in 1824.</p>
<p>The bones of no Hawaiian chief were ever more securely hidden than
were those of the distinguished <i>alii-nui</i> Kualii, who ruled with
a strong arm the turbulent factions of the island of Oahu some two
centuries back. After the flesh had been stripped from the bones they
were given in charge of a trusty friend to be secreted, and most
effectually did he accomplish the delicate task assigned him. He had
them pulverized to a fine powder, which he mixed with the <i>poi</i> to
be served at the funeral feast to be given to the principal chiefs the
day following. At the close of the repast, when asked if he had
secreted the bones of the dead chief to his satisfaction, he grimly
replied: &ldquo;Hidden, indeed, are the bones of Kualii! They have been
deposited in a hundred living sepulchres. You have eaten
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we are wandering somewhat from our story. The day <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>after the death of Liloa, Hakau was
ceremoniously invested with supreme authority, while the high-priest
Laeanui gave formal recognition to Umi as guardian of the gods and
temples. Both events were celebrated with display and sacrifice; but it
is said that the scream of the <i>alae</i>, a sacred bird of evil omen,
was heard around the palace all through the night that Hakau first
slept there as king, and that as Umi entered the temple of
<i>Paakalani</i> to assume the guardianship of the gods the head of the
great image of <i>Lono</i>, near the door of the inner temple, nodded
approvingly.</p>
<p>Independently of Umi&rsquo;s position as prime minister or royal
adviser, his authority as guardian of the gods and temples was second
only to that of the king, and Hakau chafed under a bequest that had
clothed his brother with a power little less than his own and placed
him so near the throne. The consequence was that he seldom invited him
to his councils, and secretly sought to cast discredit upon his acts as
the nominal head of the priesthood. But Umi bore himself so nobly that
Hakau&rsquo;s venom brought no poison to him, and the petty
persecutions to which he was subjected not only failed to injure him,
but actually added to his popularity with those who had felt the
barbarity of his brother, whose first acts on coming to power were to
dismiss, disrate and impoverish many of the old and faithful servants
and counselors of his father, and surround himself with a party of
unscrupulous retainers as cruel and treacherous as himself.</p>
<p>Enraged that his secret and cowardly slanders of Umi failed to bring
him into disrespect, Hakau&rsquo;s hostility began to assume a more
open and brutal form. He publicly reviled his brother for his low
birth, and assumed not only that Liloa was not his father, but that his
mother was a woman without any distinction of blood.</p>
<p>Unable to bear these taunts, and not deeming it prudent to
precipitate an open rupture with his brother, Umi quietly left Waipio
with his two friends Piimaiwaa and Omaukamau, and, traveling through
Hamakua without stopping at Kealakaha, where dwelt his mother and
Kulamea, proceeded at once to Waipunalei, near Laupahoehoe, in the
district of Hilo, where he concluded to remain for a time and await the
development of events.</p>
<p>To support themselves Umi and his two friends devoted a portion of
their time to fishing, bird-catching and the making of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>canoes, spears and other weapons; and although
the rank of Umi was studiously concealed, his intelligence, skilful use
of arms and general bearing could not fail to attract attention and
excite the curiosity of his humble associates. Not unfrequently
strangers would prostrate themselves before him, so profoundly were
they impressed with his appearance, but he declined to accept their
homage and smilingly assured them that he was born and reared, like
themselves, in humble life. As a further precaution against
recognition, he carefully avoided the prominent chiefs of the district,
deeming it probable that some of them had seen him in Waipio, or even
witnessed the ceremonies attending his acceptance as the son of
Liloa.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was not destined that Umi should remain long
unknown among the hills of Hilo. His sudden disappearance and continued
absence from the court had excited apprehensions of foul dealing, and
Hakau himself, who had thus far failed in his efforts to discover the
retreat of Umi, began to fear that he was somewhere secretly planning a
deep scheme of retaliation. But Umi had as yet marked out for himself
no definite plan of action. He smarted under the persecutions of Hakau,
and did not doubt that, sooner or later, he would triumph over them and
be restored to the rights and privileges bequeathed to him by his royal
father; but exactly when and how all this was to be accomplished were
problems which he expected the future to assist him in solving.</p>
<p>And he was not disappointed. The future for which he had patiently
waited was near at hand, and he was about to become the central figure
of a struggle which would test to their utmost his courage and ability.
One day, while strolling alone in the hills back of Waipunalei, there
suddenly appeared before him a man of stupendous proportions. Umi
regarded the object for a moment with amazement, and was about to speak
when the monster dropped on his knees before him. In that position he
was a head and shoulders above Umi, and the spear in his hand was of
the measure in length of ten full steps. Although more than eleven feet
in height, he was well proportioned, and the expression of his face was
intelligent and gentle. He was young <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb280" href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>in years, yet his
hair fell to his shoulders and was streaked with gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, and why do you kneel to me?&rdquo; said Umi,
looking up into the face of the giant with a feeling of awe. &ldquo;If
I had your limbs I would kneel alone to the gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Maukaleoleo, of Kona, and the most unfortunate of
men,&rdquo; replied the monster in a ponderous but not unpleasant tone.
&ldquo;My mother was Nuuheli; but she is now dead, and, having grown to
the height of the trees, I live in the mountains among them, for men
seem to fear and hate me, and women and children scream with fright at
my approach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who was your father?&rdquo; inquired Umi, kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he died when I was young,&rdquo; returned the giant,
&ldquo;and that was more than thirty years ago, I know not, except that
his name was Mano, and that he claimed lineage from Kahaukapu, the
grandfather of the great Liloa, whose unworthy son now rules in
Hawaii.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; exclaimed Umi, reaching up and placing his hand
gently upon the shoulder of the monster. &ldquo;There is death in such
words, even to a man of Maukaleoleo&rsquo;s girth. The trees are
listeners as well as myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trees will say nothing,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;for
they often hear such words of Hakau. But why should I fear death? I was
not born to be slain for speaking the truth. Listen, and then tell me
why Maukaleoleo should fear anything that is human. When a boy a
stranger met me one day on the cliffs overlooking the sea, where I was
searching for the feathers of the <i>oo</i>. He was mighty in stature,
and in fear I fell upon the ground and hid my face. He called me by
name, and I looked up and saw that he held in his hand a small fish of
the color of the skies at sunset. Handing the fish to me, he said:
&lsquo;Eat this, and to see your face all men will look toward the
stars.&rsquo; I knew he was a god&mdash;<i>Kanaloa</i>,
perhaps&mdash;and I feared to refuse. So I took the fish and ate it,
and the stranger stepped over the cliffs with a smile on his face and
disappeared. The fish was pleasant to the taste, and I could have eaten
more. A strange sense of increasing strength seized me, and on my way
home I lifted large rocks and felt that I could uproot trees. I said
nothing to my mother of what had happened, but the next morning she
looked at me with fright and wonder, for during the night I had grown
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>an arm&rsquo;s length in height. Except upon my
hands and knees I could no longer enter the door of the house where I
was born, and everything with which I was familiar had a dwarfed and
unnatural look. I was ashamed to meet my old associates, and only
ventured from the house when it was too dark for me to be plainly seen.
Larger and larger I grew, until at the age of fifteen I reached my
present proportions, when my mother died, and I made my home in the
mountains, where I have since spent the most of my time. What should
one so treated by the gods fear from man?&rdquo; And Maukaleoleo rose
to his feet, towering like a cocoa-tree above his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange story, indeed! But if the trees, which are
speechless, do not betray you, why should not I?&rdquo; said Umi,
curious to learn something farther of the strange being in whose veins
possibly coursed the blood of kings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; answered the giant, slowly, &ldquo;you are
Umi, the son of Liloa, and Hakau is your enemy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Umi listened to these words in amazement, and then frankly said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right. I am Umi, the son of Liloa, and Hakau is not
my friend. And now that you know so much, you cannot but also know that
it is prudent for me to remain at present unknown. Let me ask in return
that you will not betray me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all, and you may fear nothing,&rdquo; said
Maukaleoleo. &ldquo;Before the moon grows large again I shall be with
you, spear in hand, on your way to Waipio. Meantime you may lose sight
of me, but I shall be near you when my arm is needed. You have powerful
friends. Be guided by them, and all will be well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Umi held up his hand, and Maukaleoleo folded it in his mighty palm
as he dropped upon his knees and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umi, son of Liloa! here in the hills, among the listening
leaves, let Maukaleoleo be the first to hail you <i>moi</i> of
Hawaii!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Umi could rebuke the untimely utterance Maukaleoleo rose to
his feet and with a low bow disappeared among the trees.</p>
<p>With whatever feeling of fear the <i>makaainana</i>, or laboring
classes, of Waipunalei may have regarded Maukaleoleo, as he
occasionally appeared among them like a moving tower, he was not
without friends. He was well known to the priests and <i>kaulas</i> of
the district, who believed that his huge proportions <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>were
due to the special act of some god, and was always a welcome visitor at
the home of Kaoleioku, a high-priest of great influence both in Hilo
and Hamakua. It is therefore probable that this meeting with Umi was
not entirely accidental, for the day following Kaoleioku despatched a
messenger to Umi, who was found not without some difficulty, inviting
him to a conference in a secluded spot near the head of a neighboring
valley.</p>
<p>The object of the meeting was not stated, and Umi&rsquo;s first
thought was that the emissaries of his brother were seeking to lure him
to his death; but no danger ever appalled him, and, seizing his javelin
and thrusting a <i>pahoa</i> into his girdle, he followed the
messenger.</p>
<p>A brisk walk of an hour brought them to a small grass hut partially
hidden among the trees and undergrowth of an almost dry ravine abruptly
jutting into the valley. At that point the valley was too narrow to
admit of cultivation, although a broken stone wall across the mouth of
the ravine showed that at one time three or four uneven acres behind it
had been tilled. The grass grew rank within the enclosure, and, in
addition to several varieties of forest trees that had taken root since
the ground had last been disturbed, a half-dozen or more cocoa-trees
lifted their heads above the surrounding foliage, and the broad leaves
of as many banana-stalks swayed lazily in the wind.</p>
<p>It was a lonesome-looking spot, and no sign of life in or around the
hut was visible as the messenger stopped at a gap in the crumbling wall
and awaited the approach of Umi. The chirp of the crickets in the grass
seemed to be a note of warning, and the whistle of a solitary bird
hidden among the leaves sounded like a scream to Umi in that deserted
and otherwise silent nook; but he grasped his <i>ihe</i> firmly and
beckoned the messenger to proceed. As he stepped over the broken wall
he caught a glimpse of the ponderous form of Maukaleoleo through the
branches of a sandal-tree on the side of the hill overlooking the hut.
Under the eye of that mighty and friendly sentinel Umi dismissed all
thought of treachery or danger.</p>
<p>Reaching the door of the hut, he was met by the high-priest
Kaoleioku, who promptly extended his hand and invited him to enter,
while the messenger withdrew from the enclosure and took a position
where he commanded a view of the valley above and below the mouth of
the ravine. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span></p>
<p>There was no furniture in the hut beyond two or three rickety
shelves, and on one side a raised platform of earth, which, with a
<i>kapa</i> covering, might have been used either as a bed or seat. On
entering the priest requested Umi to be seated, and then bowed low and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot doubt that I am standing before Umi, son of Liloa,
and guardian of our sacred temples and our fathers&rsquo; gods.&rdquo;
To these words the priest silently awaited an answer.</p>
<p>Umi did not reply at once; but after giving the face of the priest a
searching glance, and recalling his meeting with Maukaleoleo the day
before, and the vision through the branches of the sandal-tree, he
frankly answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot deny it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; you cannot, indeed!&rdquo; returned the priest,
fervently; &ldquo;for so have the clouds told me, and so has it been
whispered in my dreams. Word has come to me from Waipio that Hakau
knows you are in Waipunalei, and his emissaries are already here with
orders to assassinate you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then further disguise would be useless, further delay
cowardly!&rdquo; exclaimed Umi, rising from his seat and grasping his
<i>ihe</i>. &ldquo;His cruelty forces me at last to strike! The time
for action has come, and, spear in hand, as befits a son of Liloa, I
will face the royal murderer in Waipio, and the black <i>kapa</i> shall
be his or mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoken like a king and a son of a king!&rdquo; returned the
priest with enthusiasm, grasping Umi by the hand. &ldquo;But you will
not go alone. Come to me with your friends to-morrow&mdash;if possible
to-night. Under my roof you will be safe, and there we will gather the
spears that will make your journey to Waipio a triumphal
march.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks are the only payment I can now make to your
friendship,&rdquo; said Umi, in turn pressing the hand of the priest.
&ldquo;You may expect me and a few of my friends before another rising
of the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a few hasty words of explanation Umi left the hut with his
heart on fire, and the priest watched him with a smile until he passed
the broken wall. There he was rejoined by the messenger, who silently
preceded him down the valley.</p>
<p>As he started to return Umi looked toward the sandal-tree
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>above the hut. Maukaleoleo was no longer there,
but he frequently discerned a mighty form moving down the valley along
the wooded hillside, and knew that his great friend was not far
away.</p>
<p>The northeastern coast of the island of Hawaii presents an almost
continuous succession of valleys, with intervening uplands rising
gently for a few miles, and then more abruptly toward the snows of
Mauna Kea and the clouds. The rains are abundant on that side of the
island, and the fertile plateau, boldly fronting the sea with a line of
cliffs from fifty to a hundred feet in height, is scored at intervals
of one or two miles with deep and almost impassable gulches, whose
waters reach the ocean either through rocky channels worn to the level
of the waves, or in cascades leaping from the cliffs and streaking the
coast from Hilo to Waipio with lines which seem to be of molten silver
from the great crucible of Kilauea.</p>
<p>In the time of Liloa, and later, this plateau was thickly populated,
and, requiring no irrigation, was cultivated from the sea upward to the
line of frost. A few <i>kalo</i> patches are still seen, and bananas
grow, as of old, in secluded spots and along the banks of the ravines;
but the broad acres are green with cane, and the whistle of the
sugar-mill is heard above the roar of the surf that beats against the
rock-bound front of Hamakua.</p>
<p>In the first of these valleys south of Waipunalei was the estate of
the high-priest Kaoleioku, which was thickly dotted with the huts of
his tenants, and embraced some of the finest banana, cocoa and
breadfruit groves in the district. For the accommodation of himself and
family were two large mansions, constructed of heavy timbers and
surrounded by a substantial stone wall. The priest was learned and
hospitable, and his influence was second in the district only to that
of the <i>alii-okane</i>.</p>
<p>Anticipating the arrival of Umi and his friends during the night,
the priest had placed a watchman at the gate on retiring, with
instructions to wake him should any one unknown to the sentinel apply
for admission before morning. But Kaoleioku could not sleep, for his
mind was filled with the shadows of coming events. He had discovered a
son of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>Liloa, the rightful guardian of the temples and
his gods, secreted among the <i>makaainani</i> to escape the
persecutions of his tyrannical and heartless brother; and as a
reconciliation between them did not seem to be possible, he had
resolved to urge Umi into open revolt at once, and to assist him to the
full extent of his power in organizing a force to contest with Hakau
the right to the sovereignty of Hawaii. This he was moved to do, not
more because Hakau was a tyrant, than that he had sought to degrade the
priesthood, of which Umi was the nominal head, and in the dedication of
a temple in Waimea had sacrilegiously usurped the powers and privileges
of the high-priest. Should the revolt prove unsuccessful, his life, he
well knew, would be one of the forfeits of the failure; but the priest
was a courageous man, and did not hesitate to accept the hazard of the
perilous undertaking. Although reared in the priesthood, he could wield
a spear with the best, and when in arms his fifty years sat lightly
upon him.</p>
<p>With his mind filled with the details of the dangerous labors before
him, the priest tossed restlessly upon his couch of <i>kapa</i> until
past midnight, when he rose and strolled out among the palms. Wearied
with walking, he stretched himself upon the grass, and, fanned by the
trade-winds and soothed by the stars which seemed to smile upon him
through the branches of the trees, he followed his troubled thoughts
into the land of dreams; and there a voice said to him thrice:
&ldquo;Let the spears of Hakau be sent beyond the call of the
<i>Kiha-pu</i>, and the victory of Umi will be bloodless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A voice beside the sleeper awoke him, and he was informed by the
watchman that a considerable number of strangers were at the gate and
desired admission. The priest rose to his feet, and, with the
mysterious words of the dream still ringing in his ears, proceeded to
the gate, where the tall form of Umi loomed up in the darkness. Giving
him his hand with a warm word of welcome, the priest was about to
conduct him within when he was startled at the sudden appearance at the
gate of a party of armed and resolute-looking men&mdash;how many he was
unable to distinguish.</p>
<p>The priest was about to speak when Umi laid his hand upon his
shoulder and said in a low voice: &ldquo;All trusty friends.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then all are welcome,&rdquo; replied the priest, and, giving
an order to the watchman, he stepped aside with Umi, when two hundred
warriors, appareled for battle, silently filed in double rank through
the opening, following Omaukamau and Piimaiwaa to quarters evidently
prepared for a much greater number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, a good beginning!&rdquo; exclaimed the priest, with
enthusiasm, as the last of the little army passed the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few that my good friends have been sounding since
yesterday,&rdquo; said Umi, modestly. &ldquo;They do not know me yet as
Umi, but are inspired with a hatred for Hakau. The number could have
been greatly increased, but I feared your ability to accommodate more
without warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was thoughtful; but ten times their number can be secreted
within these walls. But come,&rdquo; continued the priest, taking the
arm of Umi and proceeding toward the larger mansion; &ldquo;there is
red in the east, and you must have rest and sleep. When you awake I
will give you a dream to interpret. It relates to the business before
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me of the dream before I sleep, good Kaoleioku,&rdquo;
urged Umi, pleasantly, &ldquo;and perhaps some god may whisper an
answer to it in my slumbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well thought,&rdquo; replied the priest; and he related his
dream to Umi as he conducted him to a room in the large <i>hale</i> and
pointed to a pile of soft <i>kapa</i> on a low platform.</p>
<p>The priest bowed and retired, and Umi, who had rested but little for
three days, threw himself upon the <i>kapa-moe</i> and slept soundly
until the sun was high in the heavens.</p>
<p>The young chief awoke greatly refreshed, and, after his morning
bath, sought the presence of the priest, who since daylight had been
busily engaged in despatching messengers to his friends in various
parts of the district, and even to Puna and Hamakua, and arranging for
supplies of arms, provisions and other warlike stores. Against the
walls of the enclosure a number of long sheds had been hastily
constructed, under which, screened from observation from without, men
were repointing spears and <i>ihes</i>, and repairing slings, daggers
and other weapons. In fact, the enclosure began to assume the
appearance of a military camp rather than the peaceful habitation of a
priest; and as Umi looked around him he appreciated for the first time
that a step had been taken which could not be retraced, and that the
lives <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>of himself and many of his friends could be
saved alone by destroying Hakau, in whose heart lived no feeling of
mercy. But, as the conflict had been forced upon him, he accepted it
without fear or regret, and his courage would not permit him to doubt
the result.</p>
<p>Umi greeted and thanked the priest for the warlike preparations
visible on all sides, and over their morning meal together were
discussed the resources and details of the coming struggle. It was not
believed that a sufficient force could be rallied in the district to
make head against the battalions of the king in open fight, for news of
the ripening rebellion was spreading in the neighborhood and would soon
reach Waipio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we lack in spears must be made up in cunning,&rdquo;
said the priest, confidently. &ldquo;The gods are with us, and the
means of victory will be pointed out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replied Umi, thoughtfully; &ldquo;but
sometimes the direction is vague and we are apt to mistake it. Olopana
failed to interpret correctly the will of <i>Kane</i>, as sent to him
through his high-priest, and was driven by the floods from Waipio, and
compelled to return to <i>Kahiki</i>, the land of his
fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; returned the priest, not a little astonished at
Umi&rsquo;s knowledge of the ancient chiefs of Hawaii, &ldquo;and we
must not fall into the same error. The gods, perhaps, have already
spoken. &lsquo;Let the spears of Hakau be sent beyond the call of the
<i>Kiha-pu</i>,&rsquo; are the words that have come to me, but I can
find no interpretation of them. We must make sacrifice at once, and
consult the <i>kaulas</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be well,&rdquo; said Umi; &ldquo;yet it may be
that a hint of their meaning, if nothing more, has been sent to me. I
slept with the words this morning, you will remember, and now I recall
that a whisper advised that we should take to our counsel Nunu and
Kakohe, of Waipio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have made the way clear!&rdquo; exclaimed the priest,
earnestly. &ldquo;I know the men well. They are priests of influence
and large learning. They were the advisers of Liloa, and are now the
enemies of Hakau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; said Umi; &ldquo;I have met them
both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then will we despatch a discreet messenger for them at
once,&rdquo; returned the priest, rising abruptly. &ldquo;Every moment
is precious, and their counsel may be the voice of the gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, while the messenger is on his way to Waipio, it may
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>be in place to make some further mention of the
two priests in search of whom he was sent, as they contributed in no
small measure to Umi&rsquo;s final success, and were thereafter rated
among his confidential counsellors.</p>
<p>Nunu and Kakohe were chiefs of distinction and belonged to the
priesthood. They were both learned in the lore of the gods and the
traditions of the people, and were so highly esteemed by Liloa that he
frequently invited them to the royal mansion, and late in life spent
one or more evenings with them in each month, when he listened to
recitals of the traditions of his fathers, and mistier lines of
demi-gods and heroes stretching backward in unbroken thread to the
morning of creation. They were among the few who could recite the
sacred genealogical <i>mele</i> of <i>Kumuhonua</i>, the Hawaiian Adam,
and he loved to listen to the naming of the generations from the first
man to <i>Nuu</i>, of the great flood, and thence to <i>Wakea</i>, and
downward still nearly sixty generations to himself. Some differences
existing between the genealogies of Hawaii and Maui, Liloa had sent
them to the latter island to confer with its priests and historians,
with the view of reconciling their disagreements. Their mission was
successful, and what is known as the <i>Ulu</i> genealogy was the
result of the learned conference.</p>
<p>These were among the friends of Liloa who, for the sake of the
father and the honor of the royal line, had patiently and earnestly
sought to divert Hakau from his barbarous practices. But he had scorned
their kind offices, made light of their learning, and finally denied
them admission to the palace. He hoped by his cruelty to drive them
from Waipio; but in the prophetic flames they had read their future,
and from within the sacred <i>anu</i> of the temple voices had come to
them enjoining patience; so they sat down and waited.</p>
<p>Arriving at Waipio, the messenger of Kaoleioku had but little
difficulty in finding the two priests of whom he was in search. It was
some hours after nightfall, but on inquiry he was directed to their
humble dwelling on the south side of the stream, and soon stood at
their door. It was dark within, and on making his presence known two
men appeared at the opening. The messenger saluted them politely, and,
observing but a single person, they cautiously stepped from the door
and inquired of the visitor his business with them. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span></p>
<p>By their garb and bearing he knew them to be priests, but that was
not enough; he could afford to make no mistake, so he dissembled and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have probably been misinformed; this is not the house of
Monana, the fisherman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Nunu, &ldquo;your words do not mislead
us. Whether for good or evil I know not, but you are in search of
Kakohe and Nunu, and they are here. If you have business with them,
speak; there are no listeners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The messenger answered by unfolding from a piece of <i>kapa</i> an
ivory talisman carved from a whale&rsquo;s tooth, which he handed to
Nunu, with a request that he would examine it. Stepping to a fire still
smouldering near the oven of the hut, the priest threw upon it a
handful of dry bark, which in a moment burst into a flame and enabled
him to inspect the <i>palaoa</i>. Returning and addressing a few words
to his companion, the priest said to the messenger:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are from Kaoleioku, of Waipunalei.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am from Kaoleioku, of Waipunalei,&rdquo; repeated the
messenger, bowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long since?&rdquo; inquired the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late this morning,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have traveled swiftly, for the paths are rough and
the distance is a long day&rsquo;s journey,&rdquo; suggested the
priest, cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My feet have known no rest,&rdquo; was the brief reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What news bring you of Kaoleioku?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why are you here with this <i>palaoa</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because so commanded by Kaoleioku.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are rumors of coming troubles on the borders of
Hamakua. Has Kaoleioku sent you to tell us of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here to say nothing of Kaoleioku, but to say for him,
and to say only, that he prays that Nunu and Kakohe will meet him under
his own roof at Waipunalei without delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nothing more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are discreet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am simply the bearer of a message; and now that I have
delivered it, I am waiting for such answer as you may desire to send
back with me to Kaoleioku.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290"
href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell Kaoleioku that his friends Nunu and Kakohe will be
with him by this time to-morrow. Now come,&rdquo; continued the priest,
&ldquo;there is meat in the <i>mua</i>, and you must eat, for there is
a wearying journey before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The messenger was led into an adjoining hut, where meat and
<i>poi</i> were set before him, and half an hour after he was scaling
the hills east of the valley of Waipio.</p>
<p>Although the messenger was silent, the priests felt assured that
there was a gathering of spears in the neighborhood of Waipunalei, and
that Kaoleioku was secretly inciting a revolt. They knew that Umi was
somewhere among the hills of Hilo, and felt strong in hoping that at
the proper time he would be found at the head of the movement.</p>
<p>Hakau had very much underrated the power of the priesthood, and did
not discover until too late that in seeking to persecute and degrade
Umi, who had been given charge of the gods and temples by Liloa, he had
provoked the hostility of a class which at that period of Hawaiian
history no sovereign could safely defy. If the <i>tabus</i> of the
<i>moi</i> were sacred, those of the high-priests were none the less
inviolable, and the strongest chiefs in the group were those who held
in greatest respect and enjoyed the largest friendship of the
priesthood. Like the temporal rulers, the priests inherited their
functions, and were as jealous of their prerogatives as royalty itself.
It was through them that the civil as well as the religious traditions
of the people had been brought down and perpetuated, and through their
prayers and sacrifices only that the gods could be persuaded to accord
success to important undertakings.</p>
<p>In the veins of some of the priests ran royal blood, and from time
to time they left their <i>heiaus</i> and became distinguished as
warriors; but under no circumstances did they ever relinquish their
sacred rights. They not unfrequently possessed large landed estates,
the title to which remained inalienably in the family. Such, for
example, was the Kekaha estate, in the district of Kona, Hawaii, which
was the gift of Liloa to Laeanui, and which remained with the
descendants of that eminent high-priest until the days of Kamehameha
I.</p>
<p>Such a warrior-priest of goodly possessions was Kaoleioku, of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>Waipunalei. He was the high-priest of the temple
of <i>Manini</i>, at Koholalele, which was consecrated, as before
related, in the time of Liloa. Although for some years he had seldom
officiated, except on important occasions&mdash;preferring the quieter
life of his estate at Waipunalei&mdash;he was greatly respected by the
people of the district, and his influence proved a tower of strength to
Umi.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">True to the answer returned to Kaoleioku by his
messenger, Nunu and Kakohe reached Waipunalei the following night; and
when they saw the warlike preparations, and learned that Umi was
present and that the acclaim of revolt was to be raised in his name,
they wept for joy. It was past midnight, and their limbs were weary,
but they could not sleep. At their request the door of Umi&rsquo;s room
was pointed out to them, and they went and sat down beside it. For an
hour or more they did not speak. Then, when all was still within the
walls, in a low tone they began the legendary chant of the kings of
Hawaii. As they proceeded with a record which few on the island beside
themselves could correctly repeat, their voices rose with their
enthusiasm, and in a few minutes hundreds of half-naked men crept from
their barrack lodgings and stood listening to the metric sentences of
the learned historians. As they reached the name of Kiha, Umi stepped
without the door. The priests recognized him and rose to their feet.
Then, continuing the <i>mele</i>, they chanted the name of Kiha, of
Liloa, of Hakau, and finally of Umi, represented as having wrested the
sceptre from his unworthy brother, who was hated by his subjects and
abandoned by the gods. With this they dropped on their knees before him
and boldly saluted him as <i>moi</i> of Hawaii.</p>
<p>This acquainted many of the warriors present for the first time of
Umi&rsquo;s rank, and the wildest enthusiasm seized them. They asked to
be led at once to Waipio, and were only quieted when Kaoleioku appeared
and assured them that their patriotic wishes would soon be
gratified.</p>
<p>At first Kaoleioku deemed this early development of the purposes of
the movement untimely, if not, indeed, unfortunate. Many preparations
remained to be made. It had been a suggestion <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>of
Umi that a part of the rebel forces should be sent to Waipio by water;
but the canoes necessary for the expedition had not been secured, and
not more than a thousand warriors had reported. Secrecy could no longer
be maintained, and immediate and open action appeared to be now
unavoidable. Yet it was through Nunu and Kakohe that his plans had been
thwarted, and while he felt annoyed at what they had done, he retired,
hoping they had acted advisedly in the matter.</p>
<p>The conduct of the priests was explained and approved the next
morning. They urged immediate action. Hakau was not prepared for a
sudden attack. For many years there had been no wars of consequence,
and such of his supporters as the king could hastily summon to his
assistance would be improperly armed and without discipline.</p>
<p>Their advice was for Umi to raise the standard of revolt at once.
This news they would take to Waipio, with the further information that,
although preparing for rebellion, Umi would not be strong enough to act
for some time. Alarmed, Hakau would consult the high-priest Laeanui,
who, notwithstanding their relations, was secretly his enemy, and a
plan could be devised to induce the king to send his household guards
and immediate followers to the mountains on some religious errand, when
Umi, apprised of the situation by fires kindled at intervals on the
hill-tops between Waipio and Waipunalei, could swoop down with a few
hundred resolute warriors and seize the king and the capital, and thus
with a bold stroke achieve a bloodless triumph.</p>
<p>When the priests had developed this plan of action Kaoleioku rose to
his feet and exclaimed with excitement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gods have instructed you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have spoken truly; the gods have indeed instructed our
friends!&rdquo; said Umi, impressively; &ldquo;for was it not said in
your dreams that the victory would be bloodless if the spears of Hakau
were sent beyond the call of the <i>Kiha-pu</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The meaning is now plain,&rdquo; returned the priest,
reverentially. &ldquo;The gods are with us, and we will be directed by
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the details were then carefully arranged, and the two priests
returned to Waipio. It was soon rumored that they brought news of Umi,
and Hakau sent for them, as had been expected. Fear had somewhat
humbled him, and he greeted them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293"
href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>with what seemed to be the
greatest friendship and cordiality. He even chided them for absenting
themselves so long from the royal mansion, where their visits, he
assured them, would always be welcome. They assumed to be greatly
gratified at his protestations of good-will, but secretly despised him
for his shallow hypocrisy.</p>
<p>When questioned by the king the priests frankly informed him that
they had left Umi and Kaoleioku together no longer than the day before,
and advised him to lose no time in despatching to the mountains all the
men he could summon, to gather fresh feathers of rare birds with which
to redecorate his god of war.</p>
<p>Hakau was startled by this advice, for the ceremony of
<i>kauilaakua</i> was never performed except in times of war or other
imminent peril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with assumed astonishment,
&ldquo;shall this be done because Umi lives, and you have seen him with
the high-priest of <i>Manini</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; not because Umi lives,&rdquo; replied Nunu quietly,
&ldquo;but because he is preparing for rebellion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rebellion!&rdquo; repeated Hakau, angrily. &ldquo;Does he
expect to be able to maintain himself in Hilo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His aims reach beyond Hilo,&rdquo; ventured the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Puna?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond Puna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Kau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond Kau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he must aim at the whole island,&rdquo; exclaimed Hakau,
savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the whole island,&rdquo; repeated the priest,
maliciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall have land enough to bury him, and no more!&rdquo;
hissed the king. &ldquo;But you are croakers, both of you. Before
considering your advice I shall consult Laeanui and the seers of
<i>Paakalani</i>, and hear what the gods say of this wide-spread
conspiracy, as your fears and cowardice tell the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hakau abruptly dismissed the priests, and despatched a messenger for
the high-priest Laeanui, but it was late in the afternoon before he
could be found. He was old and venerable in appearance, and his hair,
white as the snows of Mauna Kea, fell to his knees, covering his
shoulders like a veil. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href=
"#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span></p>
<p>They had met but rarely since the death of Liloa, for the old priest
seldom left the temple grounds, and Hakau as seldom visited them; and
as the bearded and white-haired prophet entered the royal mansion, all
bent respectfully before him, and a feeling of awe crept over the king
as the priest stood silently and with folded arms before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My greeting to you, venerable servant of the gods!&rdquo;
said the king.</p>
<p>The priest bowed, but remained silent, and Hakau resumed
abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have learned that Umi and a priest named Kaoleioku are
plotting treason together in Hilo, near the borders of Hamakua. What
know you of Kaoleioku?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man to be feared if he is in earnest,&rdquo; replied the
priest curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have auguries of the movement been invoked?&rdquo; inquired
the king.</p>
<p>With a gesture the priest replied in the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; continued Hakau, impetuously. &ldquo;What
are priests and temples for, if not to guard the kingdom against coming
dangers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it so please them, the gods answer when they are asked
through sacrifice,&rdquo; replied the priest; and then, with rising
anger, he continued: &ldquo;Your father respected the gods, and came to
the temple when he would consult them, and his son must do the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Hakau, discovering that the priest
neither loved nor feared him, &ldquo;I will be at the temple to-night,
some time after sunset, and have you there the best of your
diviners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall await your coming,&rdquo; replied Laeanui, briefly,
as he bowed low and retired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although he gave me his daughter,&rdquo; muttered Hakau, as
Laeanui left the room, &ldquo;he has no love for me, and I as little
for him. But no matter; I must not quarrel with him now. Wait until I
have dealt with Umi and his confederates, and then&mdash;&rdquo; But he
did not finish the sentence, for he suddenly recollected that the
high-priesthood was an inherited position, like his own, and its
bestowal was not a royal prerogative. There were bloody means of
creating vacancies, however, and these flashed through the wicked brain
of Hakau.</p>
<div class="figure p294width" id="p294"><img src="images/p294.jpg" alt=

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=

<p>The night that followed was dark, with a steady wind from the
northwest and occasional showers. It was some time after sunset before
the king entered the outer gate of the <i>heiau</i> of
<i>Paakalani</i>. He was accompanied by four attendants, two of whom
bore a muzzled pig and two fowls; the others were trusty friends. A
<i>kukui</i> torch was kept burning in front of the house of the
high-priest, another between the altar and inner court, and a third
near the entrance of the royal retreat, with which that <i>heiau</i>,
like many others, was provided. Toward the latter Hakau and his party
proceeded, and were soon joined by Laeanui and a number of officiating
priests and <i>kilos</i>.</p>
<p>Entering the royal <i>hale</i>, a few words passed between the king
and Laeanui, when the attendants of Hakau were relieved of their
burdens and sent without the enclosure. The <i>kaika</i>, or large
sacrificial drum, was then sounded with three measured strokes, and in
a few minutes six officiating priests, three of them with knives in
their hands and the others bearing torches, made their appearance. To
them the pig and fowls were entrusted, and, preceded by the
torch-bearers, the king and high-priest, followed by the attendants of
the temple, with measured pace moved toward the altar.</p>
<p>Reaching the place of sacrifice, the high-priest uttered a prayer to
the godhead, and separate supplications to <i>Kane</i>, <i>Ku</i> and
<i>Lono</i>, intoned by the assisting priests, when the fowls were
decapitated and their headless bodies placed upon the altar. The priest
watched them until they were motionless, and then opened them and
carefully examined the heart, liver and entrails of each.</p>
<p>The king glanced anxiously at the priest, but the latter made no
response. The pig was then ordered to be slain. The throat of the
animal was cut and its bleeding body was also placed upon the altar.
The flow of the blood was scrupulously noted, and, after the
respirations had been counted and the animal ceased to breathe, the
body was hastily opened. The spleen was removed and held above the head
of the priest while another prayer was spoken, and then the other
organs were separately examined.</p>
<p>Completing the inspection, Laeanui stepped back from the altar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the king, impatiently, &ldquo;what say the
gods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gods are angry, and the portents are evil,&rdquo; replied
the priest. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then promise them a hundred human sacrifices,&rdquo;
exclaimed Hakau. &ldquo;If their favor is to be purchased with blood, I
will drown the <i>heiau</i> with an ocean of it. But,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;I am not satisfied with these auguries. Let me hear
from the <i>anu</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately behind the altar was the entrance to the inner court of
the temple. Within, and about three paces back from the door, which was
covered with a wide breadth of <i>kapa</i>, was placed the <i>anu</i>,
a wicker enclosure four or five feet in diameter, in which stood the
oracle. On each side of the entrance were carved images of <i>Kane</i>,
<i>Ku</i>, <i>Lono</i> and other Hawaiian deities, while at intervals
of three or four feet along the walls a score or more of gods of lesser
potency stood guard above the sacred spot.</p>
<p>To the last request of Hakau the priest replied: &ldquo;The king
shall hear from the <i>anu</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lights were then extinguished, and all except the king and
high-priest retired some distance from the altar, that no whisper of
the oracle might reach them. Hakau was nervous as he stepped with the
priest in front of the entrance to the inner temple. A prayer was
uttered by the priest; the <i>kapa</i> screen was drawn aside by hands
unseen, and the king stood looking into the intense darkness of the
<i>sanctum sanctorum</i> of the temple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; said the priest, withdrawing behind the altar,
and leaving the king alone before the <i>anu</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; repeated a hollow voice from within the sacred
enclosure.</p>
<p>For some minutes Hakau remained awed and silent; then, in a voice
which scarcely seemed to be his own, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great power, I hear that dangers threaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dangers threaten!&rdquo; came like an echo from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How may they be averted?&rdquo; inquired the king.</p>
<p>For a time there was no answer. Finally a voice from the <i>anu</i>
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do homage to <i>Kane</i>; make glad the war-god of
Liloa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I promise,&rdquo; answered the king; &ldquo;but will
that give me victory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Victory!&rdquo; was repeated from the <i>anu</i>.</p>
<p>Elated at what he had heard, Hakau continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me, mighty spirit, whether Umi&mdash;&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more!&rdquo; interrupted the voice from within, as
the <i>kapa</i> suddenly dropped before the entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thanks for so much,&rdquo; said Hakau, turning and
joining the priest at the altar, and repeating to him, with some
favorable additions, the words that he had heard. Darkness hid the
smile upon the lips of Laeanui.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day after to-morrow we will hold here a festival to
<i>Kane</i>, and the altar shall be heaped with offerings,&rdquo; said
the king. &ldquo;To-morrow I will send my people to the mountains to
gather feathers of sacred and royal colors, and <i>Kaili</i>, the
neglected war-god of Liloa, shall be made glorious in new plumage and
glad with abundant sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; replied the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let the conspirators marshal their spears!&rdquo;
continued Hakau, confidently, &ldquo;and we will make short work of
them. They cannot be punished in the hills of Hilo. With a showing of
weakness we will lure them to Waipio, and not one of them shall escape.
We will cut off their retreat, and close in their faces the gates of
the <i>puhonui</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As already mentioned, of the two <i>puhonuis</i>, or places of
refuge, on Hawaii at that time, one was an adjunct of the <i>heiau</i>
of <i>Paakalani</i>, at Waipio. In times of war their gates, with white
flags to mark them, were always open, and those who succeeded in
passing into the enclosure were safe from assault, even though pursued
by the king himself.</p>
<p>This savage proposal to close the gates of the <i>puhonui</i> was
promptly resented by Laeanui. He would as soon have thought of tumbling
the gods from their pedestals and consigning them to the flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You suggest what is impossible,&rdquo; said the priest.
&ldquo;Since the days of Wakea the <i>puhonui</i> has been sacred. Its
gates cannot be closed to the defenceless, and the gods have said that
he who shuts them against the weak shall seek in vain their shelter
from the arm of the strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, keep them open!&rdquo; retorted the king,
sharply. &ldquo;They will run swiftly who enter them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Torches were relighted, and the king and his attendants left the
<i>heiau</i>. They had not passed beyond the outer wall before Nunu
emerged from the inner court. His was the voice that had answered the
king from the <i>anu</i>. Thus in the temple of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span><i>Paakalani</i> was shaped the destruction of
Hakau, and the priests whom he had insulted and defied opened broadly
and surely the way to his death.</p>
<p>The next morning an unusual commotion was observed in and around the
royal mansion, and as party after party left the inclosure&mdash;some
proceeding toward the sea-coast, and others up the valley and into the
mountains beyond&mdash;the villagers wondered at the proceeding, and
predicted that a strict <i>tabu</i> would soon follow, whatever might
be the occasion. But when they learned that the war-god was to be
redecorated, and an imposing religious festival was to follow the day
after, they knew that trouble of some kind was anticipated by the king,
and soon found a correct explanation of the movement in the rumors
which they, too, had heard concerning Umi and his friends in Hilo and
eastern Hamakua. The possibility of an uprising against Hakau gave them
no uneasiness, however, for his cruelties had secured for him their
hatred, while the name of Umi was to all classes a synonym of strength
and gentleness.</p>
<p>The king was not indifferent to the danger with which he was about
to be confronted, and promptly despatched <i>lunapais</i> to the
district chiefs of Kohala, Kona, and Hamakua, ordering them to report
without delay at Waipio with two thousand warriors each, while the
governor of Hilo was commanded by a special <i>lunapai</i> to march at
once with a body of warriors to Waipunalei, with the view of
precipitating the movement of Umi upon Waipio, where, it was not
doubted, he would be overwhelmed and crushed.</p>
<p>All these were proper precautions, but they were taken too late; for
at the time the feather-hunters and <i>lunapais</i> were leaving on
their respective missions, Umi, at the head of over two thousand
well-armed and resolute warriors, had reached a point within a two
hours&rsquo; march of Waipio, and was awaiting a signal to swoop down
upon the valley.</p>
<p>And now let us return to Waipunalei, and note what had been
occurring there during the preceding forty-eight hours. As soon as the
priests left for Waipio, two days before, trusty and intelligent
sentinels followed and took their respective stations, designated by
Maukaleoleo, on the summits of seven different hill-tops discernible
from each other from Waipunalei to Waipio. The first, coming eastward
from Waipio, was three miles, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299"
href="#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>perhaps, from the temple of
<i>Paakalani</i>; the last was a rocky pinnacle about four miles from
Waipunalei. This was the station of Maukaleoleo.</p>
<p>The sentinels were instructed to gather large heaps of dry grass and
bark; to keep small fires smouldering and ready for use; to vigilantly
watch the peaks in the direction of Waipio; to apply the torch the
instant a signal-fire was seen, and keep the pile burning until it was
plainly answered by the next station toward Waipunalei.</p>
<p>All that day and through the following night armed men were arriving
at the rendezvous at Kaoleioku&rsquo;s, until something more than two
thousand warriors had reported, and every spare moment of the next day
was devoted to forming them into companies and battalions, giving them
leaders and preparing them for a rapid march.</p>
<p>Many of the warriors were accompanied by their wives, daughters or
sisters; for in those days, and later, women not unfrequently followed
their fathers, brothers and husbands to battle, generally keeping in
the rear to furnish them with food and water, but sometimes, in a close
and desperate conflict, mingling bravely in the fight. In such cases
they gave and received blows, and expected and were accorded no
consideration because of their sex.</p>
<p>Instances are given in Hawaiian tradition of the tide of battle
being turned, on more than one occasion, by desperate women transformed
from camp-followers into warriors; and as late as 1819 we behold
Manona, wife of Kekuokalani, the last sturdy champion of the gods of
his fathers, falling lifeless in battle upon the body of her dead
husband at Kuamoo, while Kaahumanu and Kalakau, widows of the great
Kamehameha, commanded the fleet of canoes operating with the land
forces under Kalaimoku.</p>
<p>After the visit of the priests from Waipio the purpose of the revolt
was no longer disguised, and whenever Umi made his appearance among the
assembled and assembling warriors he was greeted with the wildest
enthusiasm. His romantic history was known to them, and had been made
the theme of song. His many triumphs at the festival given by Liloa in
honor of his formal recognition were recited by those who had witnessed
them, and his grand proportions and noble bearing stamped him
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>as of chiefly blood; and when his friends
Piimaiwaa and Omaukamau spoke of the great learning displayed by him
when questioned by the priests, and intimated that he had been
instructed by the gods and was under their care, every doubt of success
vanished, and the order for an advance upon Waipio was awaited with
impatience.</p>
<p>Maukaleoleo mysteriously came and went, but always at night, and
seldom remaining longer than a few minutes. He was known to all within
the enclosure, and allowed to pass unchallenged, as he could be
mistaken for no one else. As he strode through the gateway, bearing a
spear scarcely less than thirty feet in length, the sentinels regarded
him with awe; and when they saw him converse with Umi and then silently
depart, they shook their heads and said, &ldquo;Perhaps he is
<i>Lono</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The temple of <i>Manini</i>, dedicated by Liloa just before his
meeting with the mother of Umi, and of which Kaoleioku was the
high-priest, was a reconstruction and enlargement of an old
<i>heiau</i> which was in existence certainly as early as the time of
the warlike Kalaunuiohua, who reigned between the years 1260 and 1300.
With a large army and proportionate fleet of canoes he invaded Maui,
Molokai and Oahu, and, taking their captured sovereigns with him, made
a descent upon Kauai. But his triumphs ended there. After an obstinate
battle he was defeated and taken prisoner, but was subsequently
released and permitted to return to his own kingdom.</p>
<p>It was during the reign of this sovereign that the prophetess Waahia
lived. She accompanied him in his expeditions as far as Oahu, but
refused to proceed with him to Kauai. She declared that the gods would
bring calamity upon him if he invaded that island, and sought to
persuade him to consolidate his conquests and return to Hawaii. But the
warrior-king cared but little for priests or temples, and was in the
habit of destroying both when they failed to subserve his purposes.
Enraged at the unfavorable auguries of Waahia, and fearful that they
might come to the ears of and demoralize his warriors, the king induced
her to return to Hawaii. One tradition says she voluntarily abandoned
Kalaunuiohua, while another relates that she consented to return only
on condition that the war-god of the king be sent back with her. This
god had been in the reigning family of Hawaii since the days of Paao,
and had been sanctified by that father of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span>priesthood. To distinguish it from other
war-gods it was known as <i>Akuapaao</i>, and was held in great
veneration. When asked for an explanation of the strange request, the
prophetess boldly declared that, if the god was taken to Kauai, it
would never return except at the head of a conquering army that would
make of Hawaii a tributary kingdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take it with you!&rdquo; exclaimed the king, savagely,
&ldquo;and if I return to Hawaii alive I will burn you both
together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will burn neither,&rdquo; said Waahia. &ldquo;When you
return to Hawaii you will think better of the gods and their servants;
and in generations to come, when angry spears shall be crossed in the
<i>hale</i> of the kings of Hawaii, the hand will be stronger that
places the fresh <i>lei</i> upon the shoulders of
<i>Akuapaao</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prophetess prepared to embark. The god, wrapped in a fold of
<i>kapa</i>, so that it might not be recognized, was brought to the
beach and delivered to the departing seeress. The canoe, which was
large enough to accommodate thirty persons, was shoved into the surf.
It was provided with food and a calabash of water. Declining all
assistance or companionship in her journey, Waahia stepped into the
canoe with the image in her arms, and, after carefully depositing it in
the bow of the boat, returned and seated herself near the stern. Half a
dozen men were waiting for the word to launch the canoe from the sands
upon which the stern was lightly resting. But the seeress raised no
sail, touched no oar. For some minutes she sat, silent and motionless,
with bent head and clasped hands, as if in prayer, while hundreds of
curious eyes watched her in amazement, wondering what would become of
her, even should the unmanned craft be successful in passing the
breakers. Then she slowly rose to her feet, and the canoe began to
glide toward the reef. Faster and faster it moved, until, mounting a
retreating wave, it was borne swiftly out into the calmer waters; then,
slightly turning in its course, it dashed southward with the speed of
the wind, and was soon lost to the view of the awe-stricken
beholders.</p>
<p>Waahia looked beneath the waves and smiled, for <i>Ukanipo</i>, the
shark-god, with scores of assistants, was bearing her onward; and then
from his <i>ipu Laamaomao</i>, the Hawaiian &AElig;olus, let loose the
imprisoned winds, and refreshing zephyrs cooled the face of the
prophetess and accelerated the speed of the canoe, until it seemed to
leap from wave to wave; and great sea-birds screamed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>with
fright as it dashed past and awoke them from their billowy slumbers,
leaving behind it a long trail of troubled waters.</p>
<p>Passing to the southward of the intervening islands, the canoe was
borne with undiminished speed through the channel of Alenuihaha to the
northeastern coast of Hawaii, and before sunset was beached at
Koholalele. The prophetess knew the meaning of this. Near by was the
old <i>heiau</i> of <i>Manini</i>, and thither, as she felt instructed,
was taken and deposited the war-god <i>Akuapaao</i>, with the solemn
injunction to the high-priest in charge that it was never to be removed
from the inner court unless the life of the <i>moi</i> was in peril or
the kingdom was invaded by a foreign foe.</p>
<p>The old <i>heiau</i> had given place to a more imposing structure
during the reign of Liloa. Its outer walls had been enlarged, raised
and repaired, and its inner belongings improved and redecorated; but
its sacred relics had not been disturbed, and its many gods remained
where they had been for generations.</p>
<p>Among the most sacred idols of the temple, even after the death of
Liloa, was the <i>Akuapaao</i>. Its name indicated alike its age and
sanctity; and while the legends connected with it had become vague and
distorted in their transmission through a long line of priests, the
prophecy of Waahia still clung to it, and it was especially reverenced
by the few to whom was entrusted the secret of its functions.</p>
<p>Hakau had learned of this god from his royal father, and the same
morning that his retainers were sent to the hills for feathers two
priests were despatched to Koholalele, with orders to bring to Waipio,
in the king&rsquo;s name and without delay, the war-god
<i>Akuapaao</i>. Should the priests of the temple refuse to surrender
the idol, then the messengers were instructed to call upon the district
chiefs for assistance, and take it by force, no matter at what cost of
life.</p>
<p>But the king was too late, for at early daylight of the morning of
the day before his messengers left Waipio, Maukaleoleo strode into the
rebel headquarters with the <i>Akuapaao</i> in his arms. Kaoleioku had,
of course, instructed the giant where and how to secure the image, for
in years past he had been its custodian, and his orders continued to be
obeyed by the priests of <i>Manini</i>. The idol, completely wrapped in
<i>kapa</i>, was deposited in the private <i>heiau</i> of the
high-priest, and Maukaleoleo left the enclosure <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>as
quietly as he had entered it a few minutes before. The sentinels
wondered, as usual, but bowed in silence as he came and went.</p>
<p>The priest rose with the sun, and learned that Maukaleoleo had
already been a visitor that morning. He hastened to the <i>heiau</i>,
and there found the <i>Akuapaao</i>. He was overjoyed. He removed the
<i>kapa</i> covering from the idol, placed it upon a pedestal between
the images of <i>Ku</i> and <i>Lono</i>, and then found Umi and brought
him to the <i>heiau</i>. Entering, Kaoleioku closed the door and
pointed to the <i>Akuapaao</i>. Umi bowed reverently before it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, O Umi!&rdquo; said the priest; &ldquo;listen, O son
of Liloa! Behold the war-god of your fathers! It was sanctified by the
touch of Paao, and for generations, in the inner chamber of
<i>Manini</i>, has awaited your coming. From Waahia, the prophetess,
have come down, through the chief priests of the <i>heiau</i>, these
words: &lsquo;When angry spears shall be crossed in the hale of the
kings of Hawaii, the hand will be the stronger that places the fresh
<i>lei</i> upon the shoulders of <i>Akuapaao</i>.&rsquo; The spears are
about to be crossed; the god is here; let yours be the hand, and not
Hakau&rsquo;s, to place the <i>lei-ai</i> upon the shoulders of
<i>Akuapaao</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words of the prophecy came to Umi as a dream. Overwhelmed with
their significance, he fell upon his knees and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;God of my fathers! be you my guide until I prove unworthy of
your protection!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your realm is yet small,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;and
is enclosed within these walls. Let us pay respect to the gods, that
its boundaries may be enlarged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon a strict <i>tabu</i> was ordered to all within the walls,
to begin at midday and continue until the setting of the sun. The time
was brief, but events were pressing, and it could not safely be
extended.</p>
<p>The <i>tabu</i>, or <i>kapu</i>, as it is sometimes written, was
strictly a prerogative of the high chiefs and priests of olden Hawaii.
There were fixed <i>tabus</i> of custom, and declared <i>tabus</i> of
limited duration by the temporal and spiritual rulers. The penalty for
the violation of all <i>tabus</i> was death. It was <i>tabu</i> of
custom for men and women to eat together, or for women to eat of the
flesh of swine, fowls, turtle and many kinds of fish. Everything
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>belonging to the kings, priests and temples was
<i>tabu</i>, or sacred, and springs, paths, fishing-grounds,
water-courses, etc., were frequently thus kept from the use of the
people. Declared general <i>tabus</i>, for the propitiation of the gods
or the amelioration of a public evil, were either strict or common,
according to the emergency. During the time of a common <i>tabu</i> the
people were required to abstain from their usual avocations and attend
at the <i>heiau</i>, where morning and evening prayers were offered. A
strict <i>tabu</i> was more sacred. While it continued&mdash;generally
one or two days&mdash;all, with the exception of the <i>alii-nui</i>
and priests, were compelled to remain within doors. Every fire and
every light was extinguished; no canoe was launched; all noises ceased;
the pigs and dogs were muzzled, and fowls were placed under calabashes.
These <i>tabus</i> were proclaimed by heralds, and their wanton
violation was an unpardonable offence.</p>
<p>In preparation for the <i>tabu</i> to be declared by Umi, flowers
and feathers were brought, and <i>leis</i> of both were woven.
Everything being in readiness, heralds proclaimed the <i>tabu</i> and
its duration, with the further announcement that the occasion was the
arrival of the mighty war-god <i>Akuapaao</i> and its coming decoration
by Umi.</p>
<p>As the sun touched the mark of meridian, the gates of the enclosure
were barred and guarded by the religious attendants of the priest; the
fires were everywhere extinguished; the few animals within the walls
were either muzzled or hidden; men, women and children suddenly
disappeared within their dwellings or quarters, and mats were hung at
the openings; Umi and the priest retired alone to the <i>heiau</i> and
closed the door, and silence, disturbed only by low whispers and the
muffled footfalls of the watching priests, reigned over the twenty-five
hundred persons gathered within the enclosure.</p>
<p>In the <i>heiau</i>, or apartment of the gods, to which Umi and the
high-priest retired, were a number of images and sacred relics. Near
the centre of the room was a small altar, upon which had been deposited
the <i>leis</i> provided for the decoration of <i>Akuapaao</i>. They
sat down beside it, and for an hour or more nothing was heard but the
whispered prayers of the priest, addressed in turn to the several gods
before him. Then, rising and leading Umi by the hand to the
<i>Akuapaao</i>, in a low voice he formally presented him to the god as
the son of Liloa and rightful ruler of the Hawaiian <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>people. Another prayer was uttered, and then
Umi, with the words, &ldquo;Accept this, O <i>Akuapaao</i>, with the
homage of Umi!&rdquo; proceeded reverently to place around the head and
neck of the image a number of fragrant <i>leis</i> of flowers and
wreaths of brilliant feathers.</p>
<p>The priest watched the act intently. As the last wreath of feathers,
resembling a crown in appearance&mdash;the
<i>lei-hula-alii</i>&mdash;was placed upon the head of the image, a
sunbeam flashed through what seemed to be a small rent in the thatched
roof, and for a moment haloed the heads of Umi and the god. The priest
read the answer and smiled. He felt as assured of the favor of the gods
as if it had been pledged in a voice of thunder, and Umi bent low in
acknowledgment of the joyful revelation.</p>
<p>The sun dropped behind the hills; twilight turned to bronze the gold
of the valleys, and the <i>tabu</i> was at an end. It was proclaimed
that the auguries were highly favorable, and the silence of the
<i>tabu</i> was broken by wild strains of music and shouts of
rejoicing.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As darkness settled upon the camp of the insurgents
Umi felt that the hour for action was closely at hand. He therefore
gave orders that preparations for instant departure be maintained
throughout the night. The moon was waning, with a promise of rising
some time before morning, and the night set in dark and cloudy, with
occasional showers.</p>
<p>About two hours before midnight Maukaleoleo suddenly and silently
strode past the sentinels. Seeking Umi, he found him in council with
his friends Omaukamau, Piimaiwaa and the high-priest. They were
arranging the order of march by the four narrow paths at that time
leading to Waipio.</p>
<p>The giant stooped low and looked in upon the council through the
doorway. He could scarcely distinguish the faces within by the light of
the flambeau kept burning near the entrance. He did not attempt to
enter, but stood silent and motionless, with his hands upon his knees,
peering into the room as if to attract attention. Umi smiled as he
recognized the huge object, and stepped to the door. The giant rose
until his head <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>was above the ridge-pole, and then bowed like
the bending of a tree before the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my good friend,&rdquo; said Umi, &ldquo;after thanking
you for your last night&rsquo;s work, let me ask what word you
bring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; replied the giant. &ldquo;There is no light yet,
but I am impressed that it will be seen before morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so am I, good Maukaleoleo,&rdquo; returned the chief,
&ldquo;and your signal will find us prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I came to learn,&rdquo; answered the giant,
bowing and turning to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do not mistake for a signal the rising moon, which will
soon set its torch upon the hill-tops,&rdquo; suggested Umi,
pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless the moon should rise in the west, which it has not
done since the days of Maui, the mistake would scarcely be
possible,&rdquo; replied Maukaleoleo, with a smile upon his great face,
and then, with a few long strides, disappearing in the darkness.</p>
<p>It must have been at about the time of this interview that Hakau was
leaving the <i>heiau</i> at Waipio, after having invoked the auguries
of sacrifice and listened to the voice of Nunu from the darkness of the
inner temple. The king had scarcely passed the gate of the temple
leading to the sacred pavement of Liloa, which connected the
<i>heiau</i> with the royal mansion, and which privileged feet alone
could tread, when Nunu, after exchanging a few words with the
high-priest, also left the enclosure, but neither over the sacred
pavement nor toward the palace. Taking a path which did not seem to be
new to him, from the facility with which he traveled it by the light of
the stars, he crossed the valley and mounted the high ridge of hills
enclosing it on the southeast. Ascending the ridge for some distance,
and until the lights of the valley could no longer be seen, he
proceeded slowly upward, at intervals striking together two stones and
listening for a response. At length it came, like an echo of his own
signal, and a few minutes&rsquo; walk brought him to a large heap of
dry leaves and limbs, from behind which Kakohe rose and greeted
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire it at once!&rdquo; said Nunu. &ldquo;I will explain all
when the signal is answered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Behind a rock, a few paces away, a small fire was smouldering.
Kakohe sprang and seized a burning brand, which he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=
"pb307">307</a>]</span>applied to the heap, and in a moment the red
flames reached heavenward, throwing a lurid light upon the surrounding
hills.</p>
<p>With their backs to the fire the two priests looked anxiously toward
the south and east, and in a few minutes far in the distance gleamed an
answering flame. Satisfied that their signal had been seen and
responded to, they permitted the fire to die out, and then returned to
the valley to await the important events of the morrow.</p>
<p>Leaving the rendezvous of the rebels, Maukaleoleo slowly returned to
his station, for even his mighty limbs at times grew weary, and the
path leading up the mountain was obscure and narrow. Reaching the
summit, he examined a small fire hidden among the rocks, and was about
to stretch himself upon the ground, with his face turned eastward, when
he discerned a strange, star-like speck upon the horizon. For a moment
it paled, and then grew brighter and brighter. He stepped to a tree
near a huge pile of combustibles, and, glancing along a horizontal limb
that had been previously trimmed for the purpose, discovered that it
pointed directly toward the light. All doubt at once disappeared. He
knew it was the signal. Springing for a brand, the heap was lighted,
and by its wild glare in the darkness Maukaleoleo rapidly descended to
the valley. His fatigue had vanished, for the signal of Hakau&rsquo;s
death had been lighted by his own hands, and his great heart was in
arms.</p>
<p>The signal was at once discerned by the watchmen at Umi&rsquo;s
quarters, and in a few minutes all was quiet commotion within the
walls. Torches were lighted, armed warriors sprang with alacrity into
line, and half an hour after Umi, in feather mantle and helmet plumed
with royal colors, and preceded by the war-god <i>Akuapaao</i>, borne
upon a <i>manele</i>, or palanquin, resting upon the shoulders of
<i>kahunas</i>, with Kaoleioku as high-priest, marched out of the
enclosure, followed by two thousand well-armed and devoted supporters.
His address to his warriors was brief. &ldquo;The moments are
precious,&rdquo; said Umi, &ldquo;and must not be wasted in words. Let
our spears speak, and at sunset to-morrow we will eat meat in peace in
Waipio!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a measure of precaution, in case of disaster, a force sufficient
to hold the premises of the high-priest was left within the walls. The
advancing army was formed into three divisions, the right commanded by
Omaukamau and the left by Piimaiwaa, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb308" href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>while Umi remained
with the centre. Their orders were to move rapidly, but as quietly as
possible, by three different routes, and form a junction at their
intersection with the <i>alanui</i>, or great path, leading from the
coast to the inland village of Waimea. This junction it was expected
the left division, traveling a difficult mountain-path, would be able
to reach two or three hours after sunrise.</p>
<p>It was, perhaps, an hour short of midnight when the last of the
little army left the enclosure, followed by two or three hundred women
bearing food, water, extra weapons and a variety of camp necessaries.
The warriors were full of enthusiasm, and when Maukaleoleo stepped in
among them from the mountains like a protecting deity their shouts
could scarcely be restrained. His appearance was most welcome to Umi,
who thanked him warmly for what he had done, and expressed a desire
that he would remain near him during the march, as his familiarity with
the mountains and their paths would render his advice valuable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I see another mighty friend has opportunely
reported,&rdquo; said Umi, pleasantly, as he pointed toward the east.
&ldquo;As the moon is about to look over the hills, the torches may
soon be extinguished, for the paths will be plainer without
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The divisions separated, and, dispensing with their torches, soon
swarmed the several paths leading to Waipio. Each division was preceded
some distance in its march by a party of scouts, with instructions to
let no one pass to their front, lest he might be a messenger of
warning.</p>
<p>The paths were rough and in places almost choked with undergrowth,
and the advance was exceedingly laborious; but no word of complaint was
heard, and about the middle of the forenoon the left division, and the
last to arrive, reached the Waimea trail at a point leaving the entire
force but a short march to Waipio. A brief halt was ordered, and the
food and water brought by the women were served to their relatives, and
to others if any remained.</p>
<p>Taking no thought of himself, Umi advised his attendants to eat if
they could find food, declaring that he required nothing, and then
threw himself under the shade of a tree for a few minutes of
much-needed rest. A cool breeze fanned his heated face, on which the
beard had as yet grown but lightly, and his heavy eyelids closed,
dropping him gently into the land of shadows, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>where he bathed in cool waters and partook of
food that was delicious&mdash;more delicious, it seemed, because it was
served by Kulamea.</p>
<p>Something awoke him&mdash;he scarcely knew what&mdash;and his eyes
caught the form of a woman as it vanished behind the tree under which
he was lying. He smiled, and, partially rising, discovered on the
ground beside him a calabash of <i>poi</i>, reduced with water to the
consistency of thick gruel. His mouth and throat were parched, and,
without stopping to learn who had provided it, he raised the vessel to
his lips and drained it to the bottom. It was a goodly draught, and
refreshed him greatly.</p>
<p>Holding the empty calabash in his hand, he began to examine it, at
first carelessly, and then with greater interest, for it was not a
common vessel. Nor was it the first time that he had seen it. It was
the calabash he had carved with images of birds and flowers for Kulamea
before he went to Waipio to become the son of a king.</p>
<p>He beckoned to Maukaleoleo, who was leaning against a tree a few
paces distant, with his head among the branches. The giant smiled as he
approached, as if divining the question Umi was about to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the person who left this calabash?&rdquo;
inquired Umi, exhibiting the vessel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw her,&rdquo; replied the giant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was left by a woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you observe her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As closely as I ever observe any woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was her appearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ordinary men would describe her, I presume, as being young,
graceful and attractive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would call her a plaything, as I would any other woman
whose head did not touch my beard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Umi, smiling as his fancy pictured a
becoming mate for the giant; &ldquo;you can know but little of women.
But would you recognize the plaything who left this calabash, were you
to see her again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant intimated that he would probably recognize her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then seek among the women of the camp, and, if found,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>say to her for Umi that if she prizes the
calabash he will return it to her, if she will claim it after the sun
sets to-day and show that she is the rightful owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maukaleoleo bowed and departed on his errand, and Umi hung the
calabash at his girdle.</p>
<p>Another advance was ordered, and in an hour or less the little army
lay hidden along the brow of the ragged hills overlooking the valley of
Waipio on the south and east and extending to the sea. A fleet
messenger was despatched over the hills to a waterfall, the sound of
which could be heard dropping into the valley from a great height in an
unbroken cataract. He returned, bringing with him a strangely-marked
piece of <i>kapa</i> which he had found suspended from a limb near the
verge of the fall.</p>
<p>It was the final signal of Nunu, and implied that the king&rsquo;s
attendants had been sent to the mountains and sea-shore, and the palace
was defenceless. Preparations were made for an immediate descent into
the valley. As the paths leading down were tortuous and narrow, the
warriors were ordered to break ranks and make the descent as rapidly
and as best they could, and promptly re-form on reaching the
valley.</p>
<p>The word was given, and the advance began. First the summit bristled
with spears, then down the hillsides swept a swarm of armed men. In
their rapid descent they seemed to be hopelessly scattered, but they
re-formed on reaching the valley, and in good order advanced toward the
little stream, across which was the royal mansion, and not far from it
the temple of <i>Paakalani</i>.</p>
<p>The wildest excitement prevailed in the village. Some seized their
arms, and others ran toward the hills, but no opposition was offered.
At the head of the little army marched Umi, himself almost a giant, and
by his side the mighty Maukaleoleo, naked but for the <i>maro</i> about
his loins, and bearing a ponderous spear, the ivory point of which
could be seen above the tree-tops.</p>
<p>Plunging into and crossing the stream, detachments were despatched
at a running pace to surround the royal enclosure and cut off all
escape, especially to the <i>puhonui</i>, while with the main force Umi
advanced to the great gate of the outer wall, which had been hastily
closed and fastened, and demanded admission. No reply being made,
although a confusion of voices could be heard from within Umi was about
to order up a force to beat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href=
"#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>down the gate when Maukaleoleo
leaned his spear against the wall, and, laying hold of a rock which no
two other men could lift, hurled it against the gate, and it was torn
from its fastenings as if struck by a missile from Kilauea. He then
seized the broken obstruction and flung it from the entrance as if it
had been a screen of matting, and Umi and his followers poured into the
enclosure. Driving before them a score or two of hastily-armed
attendants of the king, they raised a wild battle-shout and rushed
toward the palace.</p>
<p>So secret had been the movement of the insurgents, and so rapid was
their advance after reaching the valley, that Hakau was not made aware
of their presence until they began to cross the stream near the royal
mansion. The first information bewildered him. Recovering, he ordered
the gates to be closed and barred, and every one to arm within the
grounds. A messenger was sent to mount the walls and report the
probable number of the assailants; but the most of them were in the
stream at the moment of observation, and the king was relieved with the
assurance that the force did not number more than one or two
hundred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we can beat them off until assistance comes,&rdquo; said
Hakau, confidently. &ldquo;Hold the gates with your lives!&rdquo; he
shouted; then, hastily entering the <i>mua</i>, he took from the
<i>ipu</i> in which it was deposited the <i>Kiha-pu</i>, the sacred
war-trumpet of the Hawaiian kings, and sprang to the front of the
palace. He placed the shell to his lips to sound a blast of alarm,
which with the breath of Liloa was wont to swell throughout a radius of
ten or twelve miles. Filling his lungs for a mighty effort, which he
doubted not would bring to his assistance the villagers and
feather-hunters despatched to the hills, he wound a blast through the
shell. But no such voice ever issued before from the mysterious
chambers of the <i>Kiha-pu</i>. Instead of a note of alarm swelling
over the hills in wild and warlike cadence, they gave forth a dreadful
discord of torture-wrung screams and groans, horrifying all within the
walls, but scarcely audible beyond them.</p>
<p>Hakau dropped the shell to the earth as if his lips had been burned
with its kiss, and with a feeling of desperation seized a javelin and
grimly awaited the onset at the gate. His suspense was brief. The gate
went down with a crash; and when he saw his handful of defenders retire
before the incoming flood of warriors led by Umi, Hakau retreated to
the <i>mua</i> with three or four <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312"
href="#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span>of his attendants, where he
resolved to defend himself to the death.</p>
<p>The door of the <i>mua</i> was scarcely barred before Umi reached
it. A hundred warriors pressed forward, but he waved them back. He
looked at Maukaleoleo, and the next moment the door was a mass of
splinters. Umi resolutely stepped within, Kaoleioku, the
warrior-priest, at his side. As he entered, with a hiss Hakau made a
thrust at him with his javelin. Umi caught and wrenched the weapon from
his grasp, and was about to strike when Kaoleioku stayed every uplifted
hand by exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold! Let this be a sacrifice, and not a murder! In the name
of the gods I slay him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words the high-priest drove his <i>ihe</i> through the
heart of Hakau, and he fell dying at the feet of Umi.</p>
<p>Hakau strove to speak, but his words were bitter and choked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear him with respect to a couch,&rdquo; said Umi. &ldquo;He
is the son of a king, and so let him die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His orders were obeyed, and Hakau, the tyrant king of Hawaii,
breathed his last as Umi turned and left the <i>mua</i>.</p>
<p>The palace was now in the possession of Umi, with its gods, its
sacred emblems, its royal regalia and all the paraphernalia of supreme
authority; but he appreciated that much remained to be done, and that,
too, without delay. The feather-hunters would soon return from the
hills and sea-shore; but they could be dealt with in detail as they
arrived in small parties, and were, therefore, not greatly to be
feared. The distant chiefs summoned by the <i>lunapais</i> of the dead
king were the principal cause of anxiety. Some time during the next day
they would begin to arrive with their quotas of warriors, and Umi was
not quite confident that they would accept the situation
peacefully.</p>
<p>To be prepared for any emergency, he ordered his entire force to
quarters within the palace grounds, despatched parties to procure
supplies of food, received the allegiance of the attendants and guards
found in and around the royal mansion, and sent out heralds to proclaim
the death of Hakau by the will of the gods, and the assumption of
sovereign authority by Umi, the son of Liloa.</p>
<p>The <i>Kiha-pu</i> was discovered near the door, where it had been
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span>dropped by Hakau. No one dared to touch it. It
was recognized by a chief who had seen it before, and who guarded it
until Umi appeared. The chief pointed to the sacred shell, and with an
exclamation of joy Umi raised it to his lips and sounded a vigorous
blast, which swept over the valleys and echoed through the hills with
its old-time voice of thunder.</p>
<p>All within the walls were startled. Kaoleioku approached, and Umi
raised the shell and repeated the sonorous blast. &ldquo;It is not the
breath of Umi,&rdquo; said the priest, impressively; &ldquo;it is the
voice of the gods proclaiming their approval of the work of this
day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The body of Hakau was removed to a small structure within the
enclosure, where it was given in charge of his wife and mother,
Kukukalani and Pinea, and their attendants, to be prepared for burial.
And Kapukini, the sister of Hakau and half-sister of Umi, mourned with
them; but her grief was not great, for Hakau had been unkind even to
her.</p>
<p>Before nightfall the feather-hunters began to come in; but the
situation was made known to them on reaching the valley, and such of
them as were not deterred by fear proceeded to the palace and gave
their adherence to Umi, thus relieving him of some slight cause of
apprehension, and considerably augmenting the strength of his little
army.</p>
<p>Umi&rsquo;s promise to his warriors was made good, for that night
they ate their meat in peace within the palace-walls at Waipio. All
needed rest, but not one of them more than Umi himself. The night was
dark, but the air was cool without, and after his evening meal Umi
strolled out and threw himself down on a fold of <i>kapa</i> under the
palms in front of the mansion. He was soon joined by Kaoleioku, his
trusty lieutenants Omaukamau and Piimaiwaa, and several chiefs of
distinction.</p>
<p>The events of the day were being discussed, and the possibilities of
the morrow, when Maukaleoleo loomed up in the darkness like the shadow
of a palm, and requested permission to approach the group. It was
granted, of course, for the giant had proven himself to be one of the
stanchest and most valuable of Umi&rsquo;s friends. But he was not
alone. Behind him, and almost hidden by his burly form, walked Kulamea.
She wore a <i>pau</i> of five folds, and over her shoulders a light
<i>kihei</i> of ornamented <i>kapa</i>. Her black hair fell below her
waist, and a woven band of blossoms encircled her head. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;By your instruction,&rdquo; said the giant, bowing before
Umi, &ldquo;I sought out the woman who left with you beyond the hills
to-day a curiously-carved calabash, and acquainted her with your wish
that she should come to you and claim it. But she feared to do so,
because you are now the king of Hawaii.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were I the king of the eight Hawaiian seas she should not
fear,&rdquo; replied Umi. &ldquo;Seek and say to her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Umi speak the words himself,&rdquo; interrupted the
giant; saying which, he advanced a few paces into a better light, and,
stepping aside, Kulamea stood revealed before the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kulamea!&rdquo; exclaimed Umi, rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kulamea!&rdquo; repeated Omaukamau, in astonishment, for he
did not know before that his sister was in Waipio. &ldquo;What evil
spirit prompted you to venture here at such a time as this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not chide her, Omaukamau,&rdquo; said Umi, placing his
hand tenderly upon the shoulder of the fair playmate of his youth.
&ldquo;The triumph of to-day is as much to her as it is to her brave
brother, and no one could be more welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Omaukamau was silent, and Kulamea sank on her knees before Umi. He
raised her to her feet and kissed her; then, taking from his girdle and
placing in her hands the calabash she had come to claim, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the presence of all here Umi returns this calabash to
Kulamea, his wife!&rdquo; Then, leading her to her brother, he
continued: &ldquo;Give her attendants, and see that she is provided
with all else that befits her station.&rdquo; Omaukamau kissed his
sister, and led her into the mansion.</p>
<p>During this scene Maukaleoleo stood looking down upon the group with
folded arms and an amused expression upon his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I should have asked your consent,&rdquo; said Umi,
smiling and looking up into the face of the giant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umi is now in a condition to take from his subjects without
asking,&rdquo; pertinently replied the monster; &ldquo;but in this
instance there seems to be no other claimant, and the title is
unquestioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have I your approval as well?&rdquo; inquired Umi, more
seriously, addressing Kaoleioku.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than mine,&rdquo; replied the priest, warmly:
&ldquo;you have the approval of the gods; for in fulfilling your pledge
to a simple and confiding woman you have kept faith with them.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span></p>
<p>The rest of the prominent events leading to, and connected with, the
accession of Umi to the moiship of Hawaii, will be very briefly
referred to. As the district chiefs and their warriors arrived at
Waipio in response to the call of the dead king, they accepted the
changed conditions without protest, and promptly tendered their
allegiance to Umi.</p>
<p>The second day after his death Hakau&rsquo;s remains were quietly
and without display taken to the hills and entombed, and the day
following Umi was publicly anointed king of Hawaii in the presence of
nearly ten thousand warriors. The games and festivities of the occasion
continued for ten days.</p>
<p>The <i>Akuapaao</i> was placed in the temple of <i>Paakalani</i>,
and at the death of the venerable Laeanui, which occurred shortly
after, Kaoleioku, who was of the family of Paao, was created high
priest.</p>
<p>Omaukamau and Piimaiwaa became the confidential advisers of Umi, as
well as his favorite military captains, and Maukaleoleo served in his
many campaigns, his strength and prowess furnishing subjects for
numerous strange stories still living in Hawaiian tradition.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What a hustling and barbaric little world in
themselves were the eight habitable islands of the Hawaiian archipelago
before the white man came to rouse the simple but warlike islanders
from the dream they had for centuries been living! Up to that time
their national life had been a long romance, abundant in strife and
deeds of chivalry, and scarcely less bountiful in episodes of love,
friendship and self-sacrifice. Situated in mid-ocean, their knowledge
of the great world, of which their island dots on the bosom of the
Pacific formed but an infinitesimal portion, did not reach beyond a
misty Kahiki, from which their fathers came some centuries before, and
the bare names of other lands marking the migratory course of their
ancestors thither.</p>
<p>The Hawaiians were barbarous, certainly, since they slew their
prisoners of war, and to their gods made sacrifice of their enemies;
since no tie of consanguinity save that of mother and son was a bar to
wedlock; since murder was scarcely a crime, and the will of the
<i>alii-nui</i> on every island was the supreme law; since the masses
were in physical bondage to their chiefs and in mental slavery to the
priesthood. Yet, with all this, they were a brave, hospitable and
unselfish people. The kings of the islands of Hawaii, Maui, Oahu and
Kauai were in almost continual warfare with each other until brought
under one government by Kamehameha I.; but the fear of foreign invasion
never disturbed them, and the people, who feared their gods, reverenced
their rulers and possessed an easy and unfailing means of sustenance
and personal comfort, were content with a condition which had been
theirs for generations and was hopeless of amelioration; for the high
chiefs in authority claimed a lineage distinct from that of the masses,
and between them frowned a gulf socially and politically impassable.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name=
"pb320">320</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Hawaiians were never cannibals. The most conspicuous of their
barbarisms was the sacrifice of human beings to their gods; but did not
the temples of early Gaul and Saxon flow with the blood of men? and did
not one of the fathers of Israel sharpen his knife to slay the body of
his son upon the altar of the God of Abraham? They knew but little of
the arts as we know them now, and the useful and precious metals were
all unknown to them; yet they made highways over the precipices, reared
massive walls of stone around their temples, carried effective weapons
into battle, and constructed capacious single and double canoes and
barges, which they navigated by the light of the stars. They had no
language either of letters or symbolism, but so accurately were their
legends preserved and transmitted that the great chiefs were able to
trace their ancestry back, generation by generation, to something like
a kinship with the children of Jacob, and even beyond in the same
manner to Noah, and thence to Adam. What wonder, then, that under their
old kings the islands of Hawaii should have been the home of romance,
and that the south wind should have sighed in numbers through the caves
of Kona?</p>
<p>And now, borne by the soft breath of the tropics, let us be wafted
to the island of Hawaii, and backward over a misty bridge of historic
<i>meles</i> to the reign of Kealiiokoloa, a son of Umi and grandson of
the famed Liloa. It was during his brief reign&mdash;extending,
perhaps, from 1520 to 1530&mdash;that for a second time a white face
was seen by the Hawaiians. A Spanish vessel from the Moluccas was
driven upon the reefs of Keei, in the district of Kona, and completely
destroyed. But two persons were saved from the wreck&mdash;the captain
and his sister. They were first thought to be gods by the simple
islanders; but as their first request was for food, which they ate with
avidity, and their next for rest, which seemed to be as necessary to
them as to other mortals, they were soon relieved of their celestial
attributes and conducted to the king, who received them graciously and
took them under his protection. The captain&mdash;named by the natives
Kukanaloa&mdash;wedded a dusky maiden of good family, and the sister
became the wife of a chief in whose veins ran royal blood.</p>
<p>On the death of Kealiiokoloa his younger brother, Keawenui, assumed
the sceptre in defiance of the right of Kukailani, his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span>nephew and son of the dead king, who was too
young to assert his authority. This he was the better enabled to do in
consequence of the sudden death of the king, possibly by poison, before
his successor had been formally named. Keawenui&rsquo;s usurpation,
however, was resisted by the leading chiefs of the island, who refused
to recognize his authority and rose in arms against him. But he
inherited something of the martial prowess of his father, Umi, and,
meeting the revolted chiefs before they had time to properly organize
their forces, destroyed them in detail, and thereafter reigned in
peace. Nor could it well have been otherwise, for the bones of the
rebellious chiefs of Kohala, Hamakua, Hilo, Puna, Kau and Kona were
among the trophies of his household, and Kukailani, lacking ambition,
was content with the lot of idleness and luxury which the crafty uncle
placed at his command.</p>
<p>And thus, while Keawenui continued in the <i>moiship</i> of Hawaii,
Kukailani, the rightful ruler, grew to manhood around the court of his
uncle. In due time the prince married, and among the children born to
him was Kaikilani, the heroine of this little story. At the age of
fifteen she was the most lovely of the maidens of Hawaii. Her face was
fairer than any other in Hilo, to which place Keawenui had removed his
court; and that is saying much, for the king was noted for his
gallantries, and the handsomest women in the kingdom were among his
retainers. If her complexion was a shade lighter than that of others,
it was because of the Castilian blood that had come to her through her
grandmother, the sister of Kukanaloa, and brighter eyes than hers never
peered through the lattices of the Guadalquivir.</p>
<p>Kaikilani became the wife of the king&rsquo;s eldest son,
Kanaloa-kuaana, and, in further atonement of the wrong he had done her
father, on his death-bed Keawenui formally conferred upon her the
<i>moiship</i> of Hawaii. Among the other sons left by Keawenui at his
death was Lono. His full name was Lonoikamakahiki. His mother was
Haokalani, in whose veins ran the best blood of Oahu.</p>
<p>Early in life Lono exhibited remarkable intelligence, and as he grew
to manhood, after the death of his father, in athletic and warlike
exercises and other manly accomplishments he had not a peer in all
Hawaii. So greatly was he admired by the people, and so manifestly was
he born to rule, that his brother, the husband <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>and
adviser of the queen, recommended that he be elevated to the
<i>moiship</i>, in equal power and dignity with Kaikilani.</p>
<p>What followed could have occurred only in Hawaii. A day was
appointed for a public trial of Lono&rsquo;s abilities before the
assembled chiefs of the kingdom. Although but twenty-three years of
age, his knowledge of warfare, of government, of the unwritten laws of
the island and the prerogatives of the <i>tabu</i> was found to be
complete; and Kawaamaukele, the venerable high-priest of Hilo, whose
white hairs swept his knees, and who had foretold Lono&rsquo;s future
when a boy, bore testimony to his thorough mastery of the legendary
annals of the people and his zeal in the worship of the gods.</p>
<p>So much for his mental acquirements. To test his physical
accomplishments the chiefs most noted for their skill, strength and
endurance were summoned from all parts of the kingdom. It was a
tournament in which one man threw down the glove to every chief in
Hawaii. The various contests continued for ten consecutive days, in the
presence of thousands of people, and between the many trials of
strength and skill were interspersed feasting, music and dancing. The
scene was brilliant. More than a hundred distinguished chiefs, in
yellow mantles and helmets, presented themselves to test the prowess of
Lono in exercises in which they individually excelled. But the mighty
grandson of Umi vanquished them all. He outran the fleetest, as well on
the plain as in bringing a ball of snow from the top of Mauna Kea. On a
level he leaped the length of two long war-spears, and in
<i>uli-maita</i>, <i>holua</i> and other athletic games he found no
rival. In a canoe contest he distanced twelve competitors, and then
plunged into the sea with a <i>pahoa</i> in his hand, and slew and
brought to the surface the body of a large shark. He caught in his
hands twenty spears hurled at him in rapid succession by as many strong
arms, and in the <i>moku-moku</i>, or wrestling contests, he broke the
limbs of three of his adversaries.</p>
<p>Among the witnesses of these contests was the still young and comely
Kaikilani. It is true that she had frequently met the young hero, and
regarded him with such favor as she might the brother of her husband;
but now, at the end of his victories, he appeared to her almost as a
god, with whom it would be an honor to share the sovereignty of the
kingdom; and when, amidst the plaudits of thousands, she threw the
royal <i>mamo</i> over <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href=
"#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span>his shoulders with her own hands,
and in doing so kissed his cheek, her husband saw that she loved Lono
better than she had ever loved him. &ldquo;The gods have decreed
it,&rdquo; said Kanaloa, in sorrow, but with no feeling of bitterness,
&ldquo;and so shall it be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He consulted with the chiefs and high-priest, and at the conclusion
of a feast the same evening, given in honor of Lono, he took his
brother by the hand and led him to the apartment of the queen. As they
entered, Kaikilani rose from a soft couch of <i>kapa</i>, and waited to
hear the purpose of their visit; for it was near the middle of the
night, and but a single <i>kukui</i> torch was burning in front of the
door. The heart of Kanaloa fluttered in his throat, but he finally
said, with apparent calmness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good Kaikilani, what I am about to say is in sorrow to
myself and in affection for you. Of all the sons of our father, Lono
seems most to have the favor of the gods. Is it strange, then, that he
should have yours as well? It is therefore deemed best by the gods, the
chiefs and myself that you accept Lono as your husband, and share with
him henceforth the government of Hawaii. Is it your will that this be
done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kaikilani was almost dazed with the abrupt announcement; but she
understood its full meaning, and, after gazing for a moment into the
face of Lono and reading no objection there, she found the courage to
answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since it is the will of the gods, it is also mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So shall it be made known by the heralds,&rdquo; said
Kanaloa, bowing to hide his grief, and leaving Lono and the queen
together.</p>
<p>Thus it was that Lono, of whom tradition relates so many romantic
stories, became the <i>moi</i> of Hawaii and the husband of the most
attractive woman of her time, Queen Kaikilani.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Peace and prosperity followed the elevation of Lono to
the throne of Hawaii. His fame as an able and sagacious ruler soon
spread to the other islands of the group, and his court as well as his
person commanded the highest respect of his subjects. Weary of
inaction, and having no desire to embroil the kingdom in a foreign war,
he at length concluded to visit some of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb324" href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>the neighboring
islands with his queen, and particularly Kauai, which he had once seen
when a boy.</p>
<p>Leaving the government in charge of his brother Kanaloa, Lono
embarked on his journey of pleasure with a number of large double
canoes and a brilliant retinue. He took with him <i>poloulous</i>,
<i>kahilis</i> and other emblems of state, and the <i>hokeo</i>, or
large calabash, containing the bones of the six rebellious chiefs slain
by his royal father at the beginning of his reign.</p>
<p>The double canoe provided for Kaikilani and her personal attendants
was fitted out in a manner becoming the rank of its royal occupant. It
was eighty feet in length, and the two together were seven feet in
width. Midway between stem and stern a continuous flooring covered both
canoes, which was enclosed to a height of six feet, thus providing the
queen with a room seven feet broad and twenty feet in length. The
apartment was abundantly supplied with cloths and mats of brilliant
colors, and the walls were decorated with festoons of shells and
<i>leis</i> of flowers and feathers. In front of the entrance stood two
<i>kahilis</i>, and behind a <i>kapa</i> screen was a carved image of
<i>Ku</i>, surrounded by a number of charms and sacred relics. The
canoes were brightly painted in alternate lines of black and yellow,
while above their ornamented prows towered the carved and feathered
forms of two gigantic birds with human heads. Forty oarsmen comprised
the crew, and sails of mats were ready to lift into every favoring
breeze.</p>
<p>The double canoe of the king was smaller and less elaborately
ornamented; and as it moved out of the harbor of Hilo, bearing the
royal ensign and followed by the sumptuous barge of the queen and the
humbler crafts of servants and retainers, the shores were lined with
people, and hundred in canoes paddled after them to give them their
parting <i>alohas</i> beyond the reef. The auguries had not been
favorable. So said the high-priest, and so had the people whispered to
each other. But, after preparing for the journey, Lono could not be
persuaded to relinquish it. It was therefore with misgivings that he
was seen to depart; and for many days thereafter sacrifices were
offered for him in the temples, and a strict <i>tabu</i> was ordered
for a period of three days, during which time no labor was performed
and a solemn silence prevailed over all the land embraced in the dread
edict. Swine were confined, fires were extinguished, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>dogs
were muzzled, fowls were hidden under calabashes, and the priests alone
were seen and heard, and they but sparingly. Such was the strict
<i>tabu</i> for the propitiation of the gods in case of emergency or
peril, and death was the certain penalty of its violation.</p>
<p>The weather was fair, and the royal party first stopped at Lahaina.
It had been Lono&rsquo;s purpose to spend a week or more at the court
of Kamalalawalu, but the <i>moi</i> was absent at the time, and the
squadron left Maui the next day for Oahu. A fair wind wafted the party
through Pailolo channel to the western point of Molokai. The sky was
clear, and Lono began to discern the tops of the mountains of eastern
Oahu, when one of his nephews threw his spear into and wounded a large
shark which for some time had been slowly moving around the bows of the
canoe. In an instant the weapon was thrown back with a violence which
drove the point through the rim of the boat. Blood tinged the waves,
but the shark disappeared.</p>
<p>Before Lono could recover from his astonishment a furious wind rose
from the south and west, and the fleet was driven around to the north
side of Molokai, and finally succeeded in effecting a landing at
Kalaupapa. Two of the canoes were destroyed during the gale, and the
thoughtless young chief who cast the spear was washed into the sea and
devoured by a school of black sharks before assistance could reach him.
Landing with his party, Lono learned from a priest the cause of the
disaster that had overtaken him. It was the god <i>Moaalii</i>, who had
taken his characteristic form of a shark and was guiding the fleet to
Oahu, that had been wounded by Lono&rsquo;s nephew.</p>
<p>The weather continued boisterous for some days, and Lono and his
party became the guests of the chiefs of Kalaupapa. It was not a very
inviting spot, and to beguile the time Lono and Kaikilani amused
themselves with the game of <i>konane</i>, played upon a checkered
board and closely resembling the game of draughts. One day, when thus
occupied in the shade of a palm near the foot of an abrupt hill, Lono
heard a voice above them. He gave but little attention to it until the
name of Kaikilani was pronounced. He listened without raising his head,
and soon heard the voice repeat:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, Kaikilani! Your lover, Heakekoa, is waiting for
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lono looked up, but could see no one above them. He inquired
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>the meaning of such words addressed to the wife
of the <i>moi</i> of Hawaii; but the queen, seemingly confused, was
either unable or unwilling to offer any explanation. Enraged at what he
hastily conceived to be an evidence of her infidelity, Lono seized the
<i>konane</i> board and struck her senseless and bleeding to the earth.
Without waiting to learn the result of his barbarous blow, Lono strode
to the beach, and, ordering his canoe launched, set sail at once for
Oahu, without leaving any orders for the remainder of the fleet.</p>
<p>As he shoved from the shore Kaikilani approached, and, holding out
her blood-stained hands, pitifully implored him to remain or take her
with him; but he waved her back in anger and resolutely put out to sea.
She watched the canoe of her impetuous husband until it became a speck
in the distance, and then with a despairing moan sank senseless upon
the sands.</p>
<p>Kaikilani was tenderly borne to her domicile by her attendants, and
for nine days struggled with a fever which threatened her life. During
all that time she tasted neither fish nor <i>poi</i>, but in her
delirium appealed continually to Lono, declaring that no one had called
to her from the cliffs. On the tenth day her mind was clear and she
partook of food, and then on her hands and knees a young woman crawled
to the side of her <i>kapa-moe</i>, and, having permission to speak,
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O queen, I am the innocent cause of your misery, and my heart
breaks for you. I am the daughter of the chief Keeokane, and he has
sent me to you. Heakekoa loves me, and it was my name, Kaikinane, that
he called from the cliffs, and not yours. It is better that confusion
should come to me than shame and grief to the queen of
Hawaii.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kaikilani admonished her attendants to remember the words of the
girl, that they might be able, if necessary, to repeat them to Lono,
and then dismissed her with presents and a promise to speak kindly of
her to her father, who was greatly annoyed at the distress which the
indiscretion of his daughter had brought to their distinguished
guest.</p>
<p>As soon as she had sufficiently recovered, Kaikilani, not knowing
what had become of her husband, sorrowfully returned to Hawaii in the
hope of finding him there and explaining away the cause of his anger.
But the news of Lono&rsquo;s assault upon her and his sudden departure
from Molokai had preceded her, probably <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb327" href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span>through the return of
some of the canoes of the fleet, and when she arrived at Kohala she
found the kingdom in a state of rebellion.</p>
<p>With the avowed intent of slaying Lono, should he return to Hawaii,
Kanaloa had assumed the regency, supported by the principal chiefs of
the island, the relatives of the queen, and all the brothers of Lono
with the exception of Pupuakea, a stalwart and warlike son of Keawenui
by an humble mother unnamed in the royal annals, and who had large
possessions in the district of Kau.</p>
<p>But Kaikilani still loved her hot-headed but instinctively generous
husband, and refused to give countenance to the revolt raised in her
behalf. She therefore hastily left Kohala at night, and, so sailing as
to escape the observation of the rebels, suddenly appeared off the
coast of Kau and placed herself in communication with Pupuakea, the
only chief of note that still adhered to the fortunes of Lono. He had
succeeded in rallying to the support of his cause a very considerable
force, but he knew that it would avail him little against the united
armies of the opposition, and after a full consideration of the
situation it was decided that Pupuakea should remain on the defensive
until the return of Lono, of whom Kaikilani resolved to go at once in
search.</p>
<p>With this understanding Kaikilani, inspired by the hope of winning
back her husband&rsquo;s love, after a few preparations started on her
errand; but not before she had made sacrifices to the gods and implored
their assistance, and Pupuakea brought word to her from the temple that
the auguries of her journey showed a line of dark clouds ending in
sunshine. But what cared she for clouds, if the sunshine of
Lono&rsquo;s presence was to come at last? But where was Lono? Perhaps
in the bottom of the sea; but, if alive, she resolved to find him, even
though the search took her through all the group to the barren rocks of
Kaula.</p>
<p>Rounding the capes of Kau and sailing nearly northward, Kaikilani
first stopped at Lahaina; but a week spent there convinced her that
Lono was not on the island of Maui. The <i>moi</i> treated her with
great respect and kindness, and offered to assist in the search for her
husband on the other islands; but she declined his services, and next
visited Lanai. Causing a thorough search to be made of that island, and
despatching a party to the windy wastes of Kahoolawe, the queen
proceeded to Molokai, to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href=
"#pb328" name="pb328">328</a>]</span>assure herself that Lono had not
returned to Kalaupapa, and then set sail for Oahu. She first landed at
Waikiki, on that island, but, learning that the king had established
his court at Kailua, departed for that place the next day, and reached
it without difficulty, for the captain of her crew was the
distinguished old navigator, Kukupea, who for a wager, in the reign of
Keawenui, had made the direct passage in a canoe between the Hawaiian
bay of Kealakeakua and the island of Niihau without sighting
intermediate land.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Leaving Kaikilani entering the bay of Kailua, it will
be in order to briefly refer to the adventures of Lono after his sudden
departure from Kalaupapa. Half-crazed at what had occurred, to divert
his thoughts from his cruelty he seized a paddle, and vigorously used
it hour after hour until he was compelled to cease through exhaustion.
The wind was fair, but, inspired by his example, twenty others plied
the paddle ceaselessly in turns of ten, and in a few hours the royal
canoe was hauled up on the beach of Kailua, on the northwestern coast
of Oahu, where, as before stated, Kakuhihewa, the <i>moi</i> of the
island, had temporarily established his court.</p>
<p>As Lono approached the shore his state attracted attention. A chief
and priest, who had at one time been in the service of Lono&rsquo;s
father, recognized the sail and insignia of the craft, and informed the
king that it must be that some one nearly connected with the royal
family of Hawaii had come to visit him. This secured to Lono a cordial
and royal welcome. Houses were set apart for his accommodation, and
food in abundance was provided for him and his attendants. Although he
scrupulously concealed his name and rank, and in that respect enjoined
the closest secrecy upon his attendants under penalty of death, his
commanding presence and personal equipment rendered it apparent that he
was either one of the sons of Keawenui or a chief of the highest rank
below the throne.</p>
<p>Pleading fatigue, and courteously desiring to be left to himself
until the day following, Lono partook of his evening meal, sent from
the table of the king, alone and in silence, and at an early hour
retired to rest. But the heat was oppressive, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span>thoughts of Kaikilani disturbed his slumbers,
and near midnight he strolled down to his canoe on the beach to catch
the cool breeze of the sea. While there another double canoe arrived
from Kauai, having on board a high chiefess, who was on her way to
Hawaii and had touched at Kailua for fresh water.</p>
<p>To pass the time Lono engaged in conversation with the fair
stranger, and so interested her that she repeated to him twice a new
<i>mele</i> that had just been composed in honor of her
name&mdash;Ohaikawiliula&mdash;and which was known only to a few of the
highest chiefs of Kauai. Portions of the celebrated chant are still
retained by old Hawaiians.</p>
<p>The <i>mele</i> diverted his mind from bitter thoughts, and when he
returned to his couch he enjoyed a refreshing sleep. At daylight the
next morning the king, without disturbing his royal guest, repaired to
the sea-shore for his customary bath just as the Kauai chiefess was
preparing to depart. Making himself known to her, she recited to him
until he was able to repeat the new <i>mele</i>, and then made sail for
Hawaii. As she had arrived after midnight, and the <i>mele</i> was new,
the king was pleased at the thought of being able to surprise Lono by
reciting it to him; but his amazement was great and his discomfiture
complete when, on meeting his guest after breakfast and bantering him
to repeat the latest Kauaian <i>mele</i>, Lono recited in full the poem
he had so quickly and correctly committed to memory the night before.
This incident is related by tradition in evidence of Lono&rsquo;s
mental capacity.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the mystery which surrounded him at the court of
Oahu, Lono soon became a great favorite there. No one could throw a
spear so far or so accurately, and in all games and exercises of
strength or skill he found no equal. He was generous and fearless, and
in his pastimes reckless of his life. Although he was beset with their
smiles and blandishments, women seemed to have no charm for him, and he
politely but firmly declined to avail himself of that feature of early
Hawaiian hospitality which held a host to be remiss in courtesy if he
failed to provide his guest with female companionship. He preferred the
sturdier contests of men, and introduced to the Oahuans a number of new
games of skill and muscle.</p>
<p>While the most of the chiefs were generous admirers of the
accomplishments of their unknown visitor, a few were jealous of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span>his popularity, among them the grand counselor
of the king, Lanahuimihaku, who on one occasion sneeringly referred to
him as &ldquo;a nameless chief.&rdquo; To this taunt Lono, towering
above his traducer with a menace of death in his face, replied that he
would flay him alive if he ever met him beyond the protection of his
king; and then he brought from his canoe the great calabash of bones,
and, exhibiting the trophies of his father&rsquo;s prowess, chanted the
names of the slain. This apprised them all that he was indeed a son of
Keawenui, but which one they did not know.</p>
<p>But Lono&rsquo;s stay in Kailua was drawing to a close, for one day,
while he was playing <i>konane</i> with the king within the enclosure
of the palace grounds, Kaikilani&rsquo;s canoe was being drawn up on
the beach below. She saw, to her great joy, the canoe of her husband,
and ascertained where he might be found. Proceeding alone toward the
royal mansion, with a fluttering heart she approached the enclosure,
and through an opening in the wall discerned the stalwart form of Lono.
Stepping aside to avoid his gaze, she began to chant his <i>mele
inoa</i>&mdash;the song of his own name. He was startled at hearing his
name mentioned in a place where he supposed it to be unknown. He raised
his head and listened, and, as the words of the <i>mele</i> floated to
him, he recognized the voice of Kaikilani. Rising to his feet, with
dignity he now addressed the king:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My royal brother, disguise is no longer necessary or fitting.
I am Lonoikamakahiki, son of Keawenui and <i>moi</i> of Hawaii, and the
gods have sent to me Kaikilani, my wife. It is her voice that we now
hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, turning and approaching the wall behind which Kaikilani was
standing, Lono began to chant her name, coupled with words of
tenderness and reconciliation; then, springing over the obstruction, he
clasped his faithful wife in his arms, and the past was forgiven and
forgotten.</p>
<p>The rank of his guests now being known, Kakuhihewa was anxious to
give them a befitting recognition; but, learning of the revolt in
Hawaii and the peril of Pupuakea, Lono embarked for his kingdom at
once. Reaching and passing Kohala, where he learned the rebels were in
force, he landed at Kealakeakua, and immediately despatched a messenger
to Pupuakea, in Kau, with information of his arrival in Puna. The
brother responded promptly, and, leading his forces over a mountain
path to avoid <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>the coast villages, joined Lono at Puuanahulu.
Meantime, Lono&rsquo;s name had brought thousands to his standard, and
on the arrival of Pupuakea he boldly attacked and defeated the
insurgents at Wailea. They were followed and again defeated at
Kaunooa.</p>
<p>Reinforcements reaching the rebels from Kohala, two other battles
were fought in rapid succession, both resulting in their defeat. In
these engagements two of Lono&rsquo;s brothers were slain, and the body
of one of them was offered as a sacrifice at the <i>heiau</i> of
Puukohola.</p>
<p>The last of the rebels were defeated at Pololu, and the island
returned to its allegiance to Lono and Kaikilani. Kanaloa-kuaana, who
originated the revolt, also submitted, and was forgiven and restored to
favor through the intercession of the queen.</p>
<p>The legends relate many subsequent romantic adventures of Lono; but
he and Kaikilani both lived to good old ages, and when they died were
succeeded in the sovereignty of Hawaii by lineal blood. <span class=

<p class="h2sub">A STORY OF ROYAL KNIGHT-ERRANTRY IN THE SIXTEENTH
CENTURY.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One of the most interesting characters distinctly
observed among the misty forms and dimly outlined events of the
remaining Hawaiian traditions of the sixteenth century is Iwikauikaua.
In him the knight-errantry of the period found a distinguished exponent
and representative, and his deeds add a bold tint to the glow of
romance and chivalry lighting up the life and reign of the great Lono,
and lend a lustre to the names and events with which they are
associated. Of royal lineage, but without estates or following beyond
his personal attendants, he sought his fortune with spear and
battle-axe, and in the end became the husband of a queen and one of the
ancestors of a long line of kings.</p>
<p>As he was the nephew of Queen Kaikilani&mdash;whose reign in Hawaii,
including that of her husband, Lono, embraced, it may be presumed, the
period between the years <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1565 and
1595&mdash;and was a stout friend and supporter of the ruling family, a
proper understanding of the rank, position and aspirations of
Iwikauikaua necessitates a brief reference to the strange political
events which surrounded his youth and conspired to shape his romantic
career.</p>
<p>When Kealiiokoloa, the son of Umi, suddenly died, in about
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1535, after a reign of perhaps not more
than ten years, he left as his heir a young son named Kukailani. His
right to the throne was unquestioned, but, as he had not been formally
designated by his father as his successor, Keawenui, the younger
brother of the dead king, assumed the sceptre, and maintained his claim
to it by meeting in battle and slaying the six principal chiefs of the
island who rebelled against the usurpation. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span></p>
<p>Kukailani seems to have possessed but little force or spirit, and
was content during his life with such maintenance as his uncle was
willing to provide. In due time he married, and became the father of
Kaikilani and Makakaualii. The former became the wife of
Kanaloa-kuaana, the eldest son of Keawenui, and subsequently the wife
of his brother Lono, as related in the legend of &ldquo;<i>Lono and
Kaikilani</i>.&rdquo; As if desirous of atoning for the injustice done
to his nephew, Kukailani, on his death-bed Keawenui named as his
successor Kaikilani, daughter of the deposed prince, and wife of
Kanaloa-kuaana, his own son. Why Keawenui restored the sceptre to his
brother&rsquo;s family through Kaikilani instead of her brother,
Makakaualii, finds ready explanation in the fact that Kaikilani was the
wife of his eldest son, through which union both families would
thereafter share in the sovereignty.</p>
<p>Makakaualii, whose claims to the <i>moiship</i> were thus overlooked
or disregarded by Keawenui, was the father of our hero, Iwikauikaua.
But, if wrong was done in the matter, it was never openly resented by
either father or son, and Iwikauikaua always remained the steadfast
friend of his royal aunt, Kaikilani.</p>
<p>The position of Kukailani, on the death of his father, was such as
could have been patiently borne only by one entirely destitute of
ambition. Custom would have accorded him ample estates and a following
consistent with his rank; but his crafty uncle did not deem it prudent
to tempt him to rebellion by according him even the powers of a
district chief. It was safer for him to remain at court, living upon
the bounty and under the watchful eye of Keawenui. He was doubtless a
high officer of the royal household, retaining the <i>tabus</i> and
<i>meles</i> of his family, and receiving the respect due to his rank;
but no lands were set apart for him, and he had no retainers beyond his
personal attendants.</p>
<p>But Kukailani seemed to be content with his situation, and so
utterly indifferent to the rights of his family that it does not appear
that he ever demanded a more befitting recognition of the claims of the
children born to him. Hence, like their father, Makakaualii and
Kaikilani were compelled to live upon the bounty of the king until the
latter was chosen to the succession.</p>
<p>And this was also the inheritance of Iwikauikaua, the son of
Makakaualii. He was a landless chief of royal blood, and circumstances
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=
"pb337">337</a>]</span>indicate that he was quite a youth when Keawenui
died and Kaikilani assumed the sceptre. He grew to manhood around the
court of his royal aunt, and was among the many who rejoiced when Lono
became her husband and, with her, the joint ruler of Hawaii.</p>
<p>In person he was handsome and imposing, and his accomplishments
befitted his rank. Through Kaikilani the <i>moiship</i> had been
restored to the Kealiiokoloa branch of the royal family, but the
previous usurpation had left him without estates, and less near than
was his due to the throne, and he chafed under his hard fortune and
resolved to retrieve it&mdash;not by rebellion or trespass upon the
rights of others, but through the channels of bold and legitimate
endeavor. When a boy a <i>kaula</i> told him that he would die either a
king or the husband of a queen, and he never forgot the prophecy. In
fact, it seems to have taken possession of him and to have become the
guiding star of his early life.</p>
<p>Iwikauikaua makes his first appearance as a striking and
consequential figure of Hawaiian tradition in the midst of the revolt
of Kanaloa-kuaana and other chiefs of Hawaii against Lono. The revolt
was organized during the absence of Lono and Kaikilani on a friendly
visit to the other islands of the group, and embraced nearly every
prominent chief in the kingdom. They had resolved to kill Lono should
he return to the island, and the conspiracy seemed to be as formidable
as time and determination could make it. With a single exception, all
the brothers of Lono were arrayed against him, and his cause was
considered almost hopeless.</p>
<p>The rebellion had its origin, avowedly, in a report that Lono had in
a fit of jealousy killed Kaikilani on the island of Molokai; but other
motives must have existed, for the return of Kaikilani with her husband
to Hawaii did not put an end to the uprising, but rather stimulated the
conspirators in their resolution to wrest the sovereignty of the island
from Lono at all hazards.</p>
<p>The only brother of Lono who refused to join in the conspiracy was
Pupuakea. He was the sturdy and warlike son of Keawenui by a mother
whose name is not mentioned by tradition, and was endowed with lands in
the district of Kau. Removing in early manhood to his estates in that
district, he seldom <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338"
name="pb338">338</a>]</span>visited the court and took no part in its
bickerings. As his mother was doubtless of an humble family, he was not
considered the equal in rank of the other sons of Keawenui, and
therefore preferred to reside where he would not be continually
reminded of his inferiority. When the revolt against Lono was organized
he was invited by Kanaloa-kuaana to give it his support; but no
promises of lands were made to him, as to other distinguished chiefs,
nor was he deemed to be of sufficient consequence to entitle him to a
voice in the councils of the rebels. This slight of Pupuakea led to the
defeat and ruin of the conspirators. The chief of whom they thought so
little had developed into a leader of influence and ability in his
distant home, and it was around him that was gathered the nucleus of
the force which in the end gave victory to Lono.</p>
<p>When Kaikilani returned alone from Molokai, and found the kingdom on
the verge of revolution, she secretly consulted with Pupuakea, as
almost the only chief of consequence to be relied upon; and when she
next returned with Lono, Pupuakea was at the head of a force large
enough to overawe the rebels of Kau, but too small to venture beyond
that district without support.</p>
<p>The main rebel army was concentrated in the district of Kohala,
which Lono avoided on his return from Oahu, landing at Kealakeakua, on
the coast of Kona. It was early in the morning when the canoes of Lono,
bearing a small party of attendants, were drawn up on the beach. No one
was there to oppose him: but the rebels were in possession of all the
machinery of the government, as well as five of the six divisions of
the island, and the outlook would have been gloomy to any one less
resolute and daring than Lono. He had less than a hundred followers,
and, taking from his canoe the <i>hokeo</i>, or calabash, containing
the bones of the six rebellious district chiefs slain by his father,
placed it within a sanctuary of mats on the beach, and beside it raised
the royal standard and <i>kahilis</i>. This done, he summoned the
people to arms, started a courier to Pupuakea, and despatched
<i>lunapais</i> to the neighboring chiefs, commanding them to march to
his assistance at once.</p>
<p>But the people were timid. The revolt was not popular, but the cause
of Lono seemed to be hopeless, and the masses hesitated. The hesitation
was brief, however. Late in the afternoon a force of five or six
hundred warriors was observed approaching <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb339" href="#pb339" name="pb339">339</a>]</span>from the northward.
Lono hastily prepared for the best defence possible, and for retreat to
his canoes should he be unable to hold his ground. Nearer and nearer
came the threatening column. It was finally halted within two hundred
paces of Lono&rsquo;s position, when from the front rank emerged a tall
young chief in feather cape and helmet. At the end of his spear was
displayed a large <i>ti</i> leaf as a token of peace. Accompanied by
two aids bearing weapons similarly bedecked, he boldly strode past the
lines of Lono and asked for the king. He was conducted to his presence,
and, observing Kaikilani beside her husband, was about to kneel when
Lono stepped forward and grasped him by the hand, exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, Iwikauikaua, for I know you come as a
friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I come as a friend,&rdquo; replied the chief, &ldquo;and
have with me a few brave warriors, whose services I now
tender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are you not afraid to be the friend of Lono at such a
time as this?&rdquo; inquired the king, glancing admiringly at the bold
front of the young chief. &ldquo;The whole island seems to be in arms
against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lono knew he was exaggerating the danger, but desired to learn the
worst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not the whole island,&rdquo; promptly replied the chief.
&ldquo;Pupuakea will soon join us with three thousand spears or more,
and it will not be long that Lono will lack warriors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; returned the king, hopefully; &ldquo;we
will find spears and axes enough in the end to clear a way to
Kohala.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kaikilani joined Lono in thanking her nephew for his timely
assistance, and Iwikauikaua retired to find quarters for his followers
and arouse others to the defence of the king.</p>
<p>The appearance of the young chief with his few hundreds of warriors
was indeed most opportune. It inspired the people with confidence in
the success of Lono, and they began to rally to his support in large
numbers; and, observing that the tide was turning in his favor, the
neighboring chiefs came to his assistance with their followers, thus
swelling his force within three days to as many thousands of warriors
of all arms.</p>
<p>Hastily organizing his little army, Lono boldly pushed on toward
Kohala, steadily recruiting his ranks as he moved, and at Puuanahulu
was joined by Pupuakea with nearly three thousand additional spears
from Kau. Thus enabled to operate on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb340" href="#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span>offensive, he
attacked and defeated the rebel army at Wailea, and again at Puako, or
at some point not far north of that place.</p>
<p>After the second engagement the rebels retreated northward, and,
receiving reinforcements from Kohala, made another stand at Puupa,
where they were again defeated, but through some mishap Iwikauikaua was
taken prisoner. They then fell back to Puukohola, near which place a
large <i>heiau</i> was maintained at that time. There Kanaloa-kakulehu,
one of the brothers of Lono, resolved to sacrifice the distinguished
prisoner.</p>
<p>Iwikauikaua received the announcement stoically. He was conducted to
the altar within the <i>heiau</i>. The assistants were in readiness to
take him beyond the walls for execution, and the priests were in
attendance to offer the sacrifice in due form to
Kanaloa-kakulehu&rsquo;s god of war. Ascending the steps of the altar,
the young chief turned to the high-priest and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready, but it is not the will of the gods that I should
be offered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What know you of the will of the gods?&rdquo; answered the
priest, sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what know you,&rdquo; returned the chief, &ldquo;since
you have not inquired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such questioning was not common at the altar, and for a moment the
priest was disconcerted. Finally he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say it is not the will of the gods. Make it so appear,
and your life shall be spared; but if you fail your right eye shall see
the left in my hand, and you will be slain with torture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So let it be!&rdquo; exclaimed the chief; and, lifting his
face upward, he addressed an audible prayer to <i>Ku</i>, <i>Uli</i>
and <i>Kama</i>. As he proceeded with the solemn invocation not an
unfavorable omen appeared. The winds died away and the birds in the
neighboring trees remained silent. Concluding the prayer, he folded his
arms and stepped down from the altar. By an unseen hand the cords that
bound his limbs had been cut, and he approached the high-priest and
bowed before him. This manifestation of the will of the gods could not
be mistaken, and Iwikauikaua was conducted to a hut within the
<i>heiau</i>, where he was advised to remain until he could leave the
place in safety. No hostile hand could be laid upon him within the
walls of the temple. There he was under the protection of the
high-priest, and beyond the reach of the highest temporal authority.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=
"pb341">341</a>]</span></p>
<p>But Iwikauikaua did not long require the protection of the
<i>heiau</i>. At daylight the next morning Lono attacked the rebels at
Puukohola, and after an obstinate battle defeated them, taking prisoner
his brother Kanaloa-kakulehu, whom he promptly ordered to be sacrificed
at the <i>heiau</i>. As he was brought to the altar for that purpose,
his last moments were embittered by the farewell which Iwikauikaua
waved to him with simulated grief as he left the enclosure to join the
victorious army. Although Lono had directed the sacrifice of his
brother in retaliation for the supposed death of Iwikauikaua, he did
not countermand the order, as he might have done in time, when he found
the latter had miraculously escaped.</p>
<p>Several other battles were fought, in all of which Iwikauikaua took
a distinguished part, and the island returned to its allegiance to Lono
and Kaikilani. The services of Papuakea were rewarded with such
additional lands of deceased rebel chiefs as he chose to accept, and
Iwikauikaua was offered possessions either in Kona or Hamakua, or a
military charge in the royal household. But in the end he decided to
accept neither. They presented to him no opportunity for such
advancement as the gods had promised, and which now, since their
manifestation in his favor at Puukohola, seemed to be almost assured to
him.</p>
<p>He had fixed his eye upon his pretty cousin Kealiiokalani, the
daughter of Kaikilani. She stood close to the throne, and evinced a
decided partiality for the dashing young chief. The gossip of the court
was that the princess loved Iwikauikaua and would be more than content
to become his wife. But royal marriages in all ages and in every clime
have been less a suggestion of hearts than of state considerations; and
so it was in this instance. Unknown to all but himself, it was the fair
face of the princess that had prompted him to espouse the cause of Lono
when it seemed to be almost hopeless, and his services certainly
entitled him to almost any reward; but Keakealanikane, the son of
Kaikilani by her first husband, Kanaloa-kuaana, had been named as
successor to the <i>moiship</i>, and Kealiiokalani was selected to
become his wife. Such marriages of close kinship were not uncommon
among the chiefly families of ancient Hawaii, and the children born to
them were accorded the very highest rank.</p>
<p>This arrangement for the succession left Iwikauikaua little to hope
for on Hawaii, and he determined to seek his fortune <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>among the other islands of the group. Tempting
inducements were held out to him to remain, but he declined them all.
To the princess alone he whispered that her betrothal to Keakealanikane
had rendered his departure advisable, and she grieved that
circumstances had decreed their separation. Ambition doubtless first
attracted him to his fair cousin; but her nature was gentle and loving,
and he finally regarded her with a sincere and romantic attachment,
which she seems to have fully reciprocated.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a large double canoe, painted red, and at its
masthead flying the pennon of an <i>aha-alii</i>, Iwikauikaua, with a
score or more of attendants, set sail from Kohala in quest of
adventure. Passing Maui, he spent some time in visiting the small
island of Lanai, where he was entertained in a princely manner by the
leading chiefs. Proceeding thence to Molokai, he remained a week or
more in the neighborhood of Kalaupapa, and then sailed for Oahu.</p>
<p>He landed at Waikiki, on that island, and was well received by
Kaihikapu, one of the three principal chiefs of Oahu. His father was
the noted Kakuhihewa, who had entertained Lono during his voluntary
exile, and who at his death, a short time before, had divided the
island among his three oldest sons, leaving the dignity of <i>moi</i>
to Kanekapu. Harmony existed among the brothers, and all of them
followed the example of their father in maintaining attractive petty
courts and imposing establishments. The <i>moi</i> retained possession
of the royal mansion at Kailua, which was two hundred and forty feet in
length and ninety in breadth, and adorned with all the taste and skill
of the period.</p>
<p>Kaihikapu had a princely mansion at Ewa, but his court was at
Waikiki at the time of the arrival of Iwikauikaua. The young chief,
whose rank was at once recognized, was provided with quarters for
himself and attendants near the court, and soon became a favorite with
the nobility<span class="corr" id="xd26e9926" title=
"Not in source">.</span> The part he had taken in the battles of Lono,
together with his miraculous escape at the temple of Puukohola, became
the talk of the court, and he was treated as a hero.</p>
<p>In the pleasure of the courts of Oahu, Iwikauikaua spent a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=
"pb343">343</a>]</span>number of years on the island, and finally
became the husband of Kauakahi, daughter of Kaihikapu. It was not a
love-match, at least so far as Iwikauikaua was concerned, for after his
marriage he squandered the most of his time for some years in roaming
from district to district and giving little heed to the future. At
length he began to crave a more active life, and was about to seek it
on some other island when the noted war of the Kawelos, of Kauai, gave
employment to his spear.</p>
<p>Kawelo had been driven from Kauai by his cousin, and, finding refuge
in Oahu, had been given lands in the Waianae Mountains by Kaihikapu.
Instead of settling there in peace, he began to construct canoes and
prepare for a return to Kauai with a force sufficient to maintain
himself on that island. Kaihikapu was finally induced to assist him,
and so substantially that he invaded Kauai, deposed and killed his
cousin, and assumed the <i>moiship</i>. Iwikauikaua took part in the
expedition, but became disgusted with the jealousies of the Kauai
chiefs and returned to Oahu at the close of the war, without attempting
to avail himself of the opportunities afforded by the rebellion.</p>
<p>His marriage with Kauakahi promised him no advancement. His hair
began to be tinged with gray, and the future presented to him no sign
of the fulfilment of the prophecy of his youth. He consulted the
<i>kaulas</i>, but they gave him no satisfaction. One of them told him,
however, that his fortunes lay to the windward, and he provisioned a
double canoe, and, with a competent crew and a few retainers, set sail
in that direction without taking leave of any one. He stopped for a few
days on Molokai, and a <i>kaula</i> there advised him to go to Maui. He
accordingly set sail for that island, where resided two of his sisters,
whom he had not seen for many years. One of them, Kapukini, was the
wife of Kauhiakama, the <i>moi</i> of Maui; and the other, Pueopokii,
of Kaaoao, a prominent chief of Kaupo.</p>
<p>He landed at Lahaina, and made himself known to Kapukini. Their
greeting was affectionate, and they had much to relate of their past
lives. She was the only wife of Kauhiakama, and he was astounded to
hear that the aged <i>moi</i> had started two days before with a
hostile army for Oahu. The object of the invasion was not clear, but
Iwikauikaua felt satisfied that it would end disastrously, and
impatiently awaited the result. The only son of Kapukini had reached
his manhood, and Iwikauikaua advised <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb344" href="#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span>his sister to prepare
for his installation as <i>moi</i>, expressing the opinion that
Kauhiakama would never return. His surmises proved to be correct.
Within ten days a mere handful of the force with which the <i>moi</i>
had embarked for Oahu returned, bringing news of the defeat and death
of Kauhiakama.</p>
<p>The <i>moi</i> had landed at Waikiki, where he was met and defeated
by the united chiefs of Oahu. He was slain during the battle, and his
body was taken to the <i>heiau</i> of Apuakehau, where it was treated
with unusual indignity&mdash;so unusual, in fact, that Kahekili, the
<i>moi</i> of Maui, many generations after remembered the act, and
retaliated in kind upon the chiefs captured by him in his conquest of
Oahu.</p>
<p>Kauhiakama had always been a rash and visionary leader, and his
tragical end did not surprise Iwikauikaua. It was on his report that
his warlike father, Kamalalawalu, had invaded Hawaii, and met defeat
and death at the hands of Lono, and with equal thoughtlessness he had
thrown a small invading force into the most thickly populated district
of Oahu, and led it to slaughter.</p>
<p>But, whatever may have been the weaknesses of Kauhiakama, a lack of
courage was certainly not one of them, and the news of his death,
together with that of the indignity visited upon his remains, created a
wild excitement among the chiefs of Maui. His son was installed as
<i>moi</i> without opposition, and a general demand for revenge went up
from the whole island. Large quotas of warriors were offered from every
district, and the young <i>moi</i> was implored to baptize the
beginning of his reign with the best blood of Oahu.</p>
<p>But Iwikauikaua advised the excited chiefs to act with discretion.
No one more than himself felt like avenging the death of Kauhiakama,
who was the husband of his sister; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he said to them,
&ldquo;the chiefs of Oahu are united, and a war upon one of them means
a conflict with the whole island. Their spears are as long and as many
as ours, and their knives are as sharp; therefore let not the chiefs of
Maui be hasty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of the chiefs agreed with Iwikauikaua that an invasion of Oahu
in revenge for the death of their <i>moi</i> would not be advisable,
and the newly-anointed king was of the same opinion; but others,
especially those who had lost friends or relatives in the late
expedition, clamored for war, and not a few of them <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>intimated that the advice of Iwikauikaua was
inspired either by friendship for the Oahuans or personal
cowardice.</p>
<p>These insinuations reached the ear of Iwikauikaua, and the manner in
which he repelled them was bold and effective. Three hundred chiefs of
the higher grades had gathered to take part in the installation of the
new <i>moi</i>, and such of them as were entitled to a voice in the
national councils were assembled to discuss the project of war and such
other matters as they might be requested to consider. As a near
relative of the royal family, Iwikauikaua had been invited to
participate in the deliberations, but he had modestly refrained from
urging his opinions, and had thus far spoken only when directly
appealed to. Several remarks of a sneering character had been dropped
within his hearing, and finally a chief from Wailuku, glancing
insultingly toward him, declared that the chiefs of Maui were
&ldquo;not afraid to use their spears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iwikauikaua could no longer bear these taunts in silence. With a
dark scowl upon his handsome face, he rose to his feet and impetuously
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor am I afraid to use mine, either in defence of the
<i>moi</i> of Maui or in challenge to any chief here who presumes to
doubt my courage! I scorn to defend myself with words! Without these
walls, with spear and battle-axe, I am prepared to answer one and
all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several chiefs sprang to their feet, as if to accept the bold
challenge, and confusion for a time prevailed; but order was restored
when Mahia, the venerable chief of Kahakuloa, rose and, commanding
silence, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chiefs of Maui, hear my words and be calm. We have invited
Iwikauikaua to advise with us, and by insulting him we degrade
ourselves. He is high in rank and distinguished for his courage. He was
the friend of the great Lono, of Hawaii, and a leader in his battles.
He is the brother of Kapukini, and our respect is his due. Some of you
have spoken words which seem to hold his valor lightly, and he has
answered, as I would have answered had the complaint been mine, by
inviting you to test the courage you doubt with spear and battle-axe.
No other answer could have been made by a brave man, and we should
respect the nobility that prompted it. We should say to Iwikauikaua,
whose body is scarred with the teeth of many battles: &lsquo;We have
spoken hastily; let us now be friends!&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span></p>
<p>The effects of the eloquent words of the old warrior were magical.
Those who had offended made prompt retraction, and looks and
expressions of courtesy and kindness came to Iwikauikaua from all parts
of the council. By reputation he was known to many of the older chiefs,
and when they recounted to the younger his chivalrous services in the
wars of Hawaii he was overwhelmed with manifestations of respect and
kindly feeling.</p>
<p>The demand for an invasion of Oahu with a large force steadily
abated with discussion and a better understanding of the danger and
uncertainty of the project, and was entirely abandoned with the sudden
appearance of a fleet of hostile canoes off the coast of Honuaula. It
was a strong predatory expedition from Hawaii. Several villages had
been plundered on the southern coast, and Wailuku was now
threatened.</p>
<p>Lono, the warlike king of Hawaii, had been dead for some years, and
under the reign of Keakealanikane several of the more powerful of the
district chiefs had assumed an attitude of comparative independence.
The most noted of these were the I family, of Hilo, and the Mahi
chiefs, of Kohala. Each could muster some thousands of warriors, and
occasional plundering or retaliatory expeditions were undertaken to the
other islands without the knowledge or countenance of the sovereign
authority.</p>
<p>The fleet discovered off the coast of Honuaula, and reported by
runners to the <i>moi</i>, was from Kohala and under the command of one
of the Mahi chiefs in person. As the young <i>moi</i> was unused to
war, Iwikauikaua offered his services, and with fifty chiefs and two
thousand warriors crossed the mountains and drove the plunderers from
the coast. As it was surmised that other expeditions of a similar or
more aggressive character might follow, the chiefs found employment for
some time in repairing canoes, establishing signals, and placing their
coast settlements in better conditions of defence.</p>
<p>Returning to Lahaina, Iwikauikaua learned from a Hilo chief on a
visit to relatives in Kauaula that Keakealanikane, king of Hawaii, had
recently died, and that Kealiiokalani, his wife, could not long survive
a cancerous ailment of the stomach with which she was afflicted. The
mention of the name of that princess brought back a flood of tender and
romantic memories, and Iwikauikaua resolved to revisit his native
island. He was begged by the young <i>moi</i> to remain as his
<i>mahana</i> and chief counsellor, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb347" href="#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span>a position to which
his rank entitled him; but he seemed to hear the voice of the dying
princess calling to him from Hawaii, and with becoming state set sail
at once for Hilo, where the royal court had been temporarily
established.</p>
<p>It was past midnight of the second day of his departure from Lahaina
when Iwikauikaua reached Hilo. He landed quietly, making himself known
to no one. He found the place still in mourning for the deceased
<i>moi</i>, and learned that Keakamahana, the elder of the two
daughters and only children of Kealiiokalani, had been formally
installed as <i>moi</i>, or queen, the day before, with the royal
mother as chief adviser or premier.</p>
<p>Early next morning Iwikauikaua, clad in a feather cape and other
insignia of rank, and accompanied by a number of attendants, proceeded
to the royal mansion. Being a chief of unquestioned rank, he was
admitted to the <i>pahale</i>, but, on applying for an audience with
the queen or her first counsellor, was told that the former was still
in mourning and could not be seen, and the latter was too ill to
receive visitors; but a proffer was made to carry any message he
desired to either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take to Kealiiokalani the words that her cousin,
Iwikauikaua, is at her door,&rdquo; said the chief.</p>
<p>At the mention of his name the <i>kahu</i> in attendance, a
venerable chief, regarded the visitor for a moment with amazement. He
had fought by his side in the wars of Lono, and in his face recognized
the dashing young chief who a generation before had been saved by the
gods from sacrifice at Puukohola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iwikauikaua, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed the <i>kahu</i>, with
emotion. &ldquo;I know you well. Years ago our spears drank blood
together, from the shores of Kona to the high lands of
Pololu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iwikauikaua was pleased at the recognition, and, after exchanging a
few pleasant words with the old <i>kahu</i>, the latter conveyed his
brief message to Kealiiokalani. She was in her own apartment at the
time, reclining on a soft couch of <i>kapa</i>, and surrounded by a
group of silent and sad-eyed attendants. Near her sat Keakamahana, the
fair young <i>moi</i>, who was doing all that affection could suggest
to soothe and strengthen her suffering mother. Prayers had been said,
offerings to the gods had been made, and renowned <i>kahunas</i> had
resorted to the most potent herbs, charms and incantations known to
them in behalf of the royal sufferer. But nothing could stay the
dreadful malady that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348"
name="pb348">348</a>]</span>was eating away her life, and all hope of
her recovery had been abandoned. The cancerous gnawing was declared by
the priests to be the work of an evil spirit, which prayer and
sacrifice could not dislodge.</p>
<p>The <i>kahu</i> delivered the message of Iwikauikaua with some
hesitation, for the condition of the patient had become more critical
since the death of her husband. But when she heard the name of the
visitor, and learned that he was without, her eyes assumed something of
the brightness of her girlhood, and she ordered him to be admitted at
once.</p>
<p>As Iwikauikaua entered he was silently conducted to the couch of
Kealiiokalani. For a moment he gazed at her wan face; for a moment she
glanced at the gray hairs which the years had brought to him since he
said farewell to her in Kohala. He knelt beside the couch. He took her
hand and held it to his heart, and the silence that followed best
interpreted the thoughts of both.</p>
<p>Rising, and learning to his embarrassment that the young woman whom
he had scarcely noticed was Keakamahana, daughter of Kealiiokalani and
queen of Hawaii, Iwikauikaua knelt respectfully before her, and
gallantly kissed the hand with which she gave him welcome. A low order
was given to an attendant by the mother, and in a moment she was alone
with the queen and Iwikauikaua. Casting her eyes around and observing
no others present, she beckoned them closer, and in broken sentences
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The black <i>kapa</i> will soon cover me. Listen,
Iwikauikaua! Early in life it was in our hearts to be the husband and
wife of each other. It was the fault of neither that we were denied
that hope. It was not my fault that you left Hawaii. It was not your
fault that I grieved when you went to other lands. But you have
returned at last. The gods have directed you back to Hawaii. They will
give to me in death what they refused to my youth. In Keakamahana I
will be your wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused for a moment, her listeners bending over her in silence,
and then continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him as your husband, Keakamahana. He is the gift of your
mother. He is brave and noble, and you will need his counsel when I am
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Overcome by these words of affection, the chief knelt beside
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name=
"pb349">349</a>]</span>the couch, and the eyes of Keakamahana were
filled with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you promise?&rdquo; inquired the mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; replied the queen, giving her hand to the
kneeling chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; repeated Iwikauikaua, as he clasped and
kissed the proffered pledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am content,&rdquo; returned the sufferer, as a smile of
happiness lighted up her face.</p>
<p>The attendants were recalled, wondering what had occurred, and
Iwikauikaua, almost bewildered, took his leave.</p>
<p>Tradition plainly recites the brief remainder of the career of this
distinguished chief. Kealiiokalani died a few days after the strange
betrothal just noted, and Iwikauikaua became the husband of Queen
Keakamahana, thus romantically fulfilling the aspiration and prophecy
of his youth.</p>
<p>Their daughter, Keakealani, succeeded her mother as queen of Hawaii,
and one of her husbands was the son of Iwikauikaua by the wife left by
him in Oahu.</p>
<p>With this adventurous and erratic chief originated, it is claimed,
the custom of burning <i>kukui</i> torches by daylight on state
occasions, especially in connection with the obsequies of persons of
royal lineage; and it was within the present generation that the
exclusive right to the ceremonial was contested by the two royal
families claiming the prerogative through descent from Iwikauikaua.
Certain customs, like chants and <i>meles</i>, are matters of
inheritance, and remain exclusively in the families with which they
originate. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The days had just begun to lengthen after the summer
solstice of 1765 when a great grief fell upon the royal court of the
island of Maui. Kamehamehanui, the king, had died very suddenly at
Wailuku, which had been his favorite place of residence, and his
brother and successor, Kahekili, had removed his court to Lahaina. The
bones of the dead king had been carefully secreted, the customary
mourning excesses had been indulged in, and many new apportionments of
lands had been made in accordance with the bequests of the deceased
<i>moi</i> and the will of his successor.</p>
<p>Kamehamehanui was an amiable sovereign, but his reign was not as
successful as that of his father, Kekaulike. His right to the sceptre
had been contested by his brother, Kauhia, and he was secured in it
only through the efforts of Alapainui, the king of Hawaii. Subsequently
Kalaniopuu, the successor of Alapainui, wrested from him the district
of Hana and the celebrated fortress of Kauwiki, and retained possession
of both at the time of Kamehamehanui&rsquo;s death. The lands of the
district might have been recaptured, perhaps, but the fortress
commanding them was well-nigh impregnable, and Hana remained a
dependency of Hawaii.</p>
<p>Kamehamehanui&rsquo;s political wife was his half-sister Namahana,
with whom he had two children; but as both of them died in their
infancy, his brother, Kahekili, succeeded him as <i>moi</i> of the
island by common consent. After the death of his brother, Kahekili at
once removed his court to Lahaina, where the customary period of
mourning was concluded.</p>
<p>It was while the members of the royal family were still in mourning
at Lahaina that a distinguished stranger suddenly landed, with a number
of personal attendants, and presented <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb354" href="#pb354" name="pb354">354</a>]</span>himself at court. His
double canoe bore the ensign of an <i>alii</i>, and his garb and
bearing showed him to be of the higher nobility. His age was perhaps
thirty years, although he looked somewhat older. He was over six feet
in height, and well proportioned. His face was handsome, and his hair
and beard were closely cropped. He was clad in a <i>maro</i> and short
feather mantle, and around his head was bound a single fold of yellow
<i>kapa</i>. By a cord of hair was suspended from his neck a
<i>palaoa</i>, or carved whale&rsquo;s tooth, and his left wrist was
ornamented with a bracelet of curious shells. He was courageous,
courtly, and in his best moods agreeable and captivating, and was a
splendid representative of the rude chivalry of his time.</p>
<p>As he stepped ashore and proceeded to the royal mansion, way was
respectfully made for him, even as a stranger of distinguished bearing,
and his name secured him admission at once to the presence of Kahekili,
who welcomed him to Lahaina, and set apart ample accommodations for
himself and lodgings for his attendants.</p>
<p>Who was this stranger? He was no common chief who would have thus
presumed to present himself at the court of the <i>moi</i> of Maui and
expect the courtesy of royal entertainment. Two generations before
Lonoikahaupu, who had peacefully inherited the sovereignty of the
western side of the island of Kauai, while the noted Kualii, of Oahu,
retained possession of the remainder, paid a royal visit of state to
the windward islands of the group. His blood was of the best in the
archipelago, and his equipment and retinue were brilliant and imposing.
He embarked with a number of large double canoes, the royal
<i>kaulua</i> being over eighty feet in length, and was attended by a
company of skilled musicians and dancers. He also took with him his
chief navigator, priest and astrologer, and a corps of personal
attendants in keeping with his rank.</p>
<p>In turn he visited Oahu, Maui and Molokai, where he was entertained
with distinguished honors, and then set sail for Hawaii, of which Keawe
was then king. Touching at Hilo, he found that the royal court had been
temporarily established in Kau, and thither he proceeded, to pay his
respects to Keawe and his beautiful but volatile wife and half-sister,
Kalani-kauleleiaiwi. He was becomingly received and entertained by the
royal couple, and spent some weeks in the enjoyment of the festivities
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=
"pb355">355</a>]</span>arranged for his amusement. The result was that
the queen became enamored of the handsome Kauaian king, who was duly
recognized at once as one of her husbands.</p>
<p>From this union a son was born, who was named Keawepoepoe, when the
father returned to Kauai and there remained. This son grew to manhood,
and by marriage with Kumaiku, of the royal line of Maui, became the
father of the three distinguished chiefs who, with Keawe-a-Heulu, were
the leading captains of Kamehameha in the conquest of the group at the
close of the eighteenth century. One of these sons of Keawepoepoe was
Keeaumoku, the Warwick of his time, the slayer and maker of kings.</p>
<p>Keeaumoku&rsquo;s first effort in king-making occurred in 1754. On
the death, in that year, of his uncle Alapainui, and the succession of
his cousin Keaweopala to the Hawaiian throne, he became dissatisfied
with his allotment of lands and raised the standard of revolt in
Kekaha. Defeated, he fled in his canoes to Kau, where Kalaniopuu had
for some years maintained himself in independence of Alapainui. Joining
their forces, they marched northward, defeated and slew Keaweopala in
Kona, and Kalaniopuu, who was the grandson of Keawe and had a valid
claim to the sovereignty, was proclaimed <i>moi</i> of Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is probable that Keeaumoku&rsquo;s services were substantially
rewarded by Kalaniopuu; but in his early years he was turbulent and
hot-tempered, and in 1765 he found a pretext for hurling defiance at
the king and fortifying himself in the northern part of Kohala.
Kalaniopuu promptly placed himself at the head of an adequate force,
took the fort by assault, and crushed the rebellion with a single blow.
But Keeaumoku escaped over the <i>pali</i> alone, reached the beach,
secured a canoe and paddled out to sea. Night coming on and the skies
being clouded, he lost his way and nearly perished through thirst and
hunger; but he finally reached Lanai, where he found friends, and not
long after sailed for Maui in a well-equipped double canoe and a
respectable retinue of attendants. He landed at Lahaina, and the reader
need not be told that the distinguished stranger who so suddenly
presented himself at the court of Kahekili, as already mentioned, was
Keeaumoku.</p>
<p>The occupation of the district of Hana by the king of Hawaii was a
source of irritation to Kahekili, and he welcomed Keeaumoku,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span>not more as an enemy of Kalaniopuu than as a
chief who might be useful to him in the war which he then meditated for
the recovery of the captured territory.</p>
<p>But Keeaumoku was not content to subsist upon the favor of Kahekili.
In his veins ran the blood of kings, and his pride rebelled against a
life of dependence, however attractive it might be made for him. But he
was without available lands or revenues, for his rebellion against
Kalaniopuu had deprived him of both, notwithstanding his inalienable
landed rights in South Kona, and he began to cast about for the means
of raising himself again to the dignity of a landed chief.</p>
<p>His eyes soon fell upon the comely Namahana, widow of Kamehamehanui.
To her belonged the fair and fertile lands of Waihee. But she was the
inheritance of Kahekili, whose purpose it was to accept her as a wife
at the end of her period of mourning. This must have been known to
Keeaumoku, who was thoroughly acquainted with royal customs of his
time; yet he paid such court to the sorrowing dowager, and so sweetly
mingled his protestations of love with her sighs of grief, that she
became his wife without consulting with the <i>moi</i>.</p>
<p>Kahekili was naturally enraged at the union, and was about to
manifest his displeasure in a manner dangerous to Keeaumoku, when
Namahana retired with her new husband to her estates at Waihee.
Kahekili&rsquo;s first impulse was to follow and slay them both; but as
Namahana was popular with the nobility, and Kahekili had not been in
power long enough to be quite sure of the fealty of the chiefs, he
discreetly concluded to leave to the future the punishment of the
offending couple.</p>
<p>Taking up his residence at Waihee, Keeaumoku enlarged and beautified
his grounds and buildings, and established a petty court of princely
etiquette and appointments. He was fond of display, and soon attracted
to Waihee many of the more accomplished young chiefs of the island. The
mother and two of the brothers of Namahana attached themselves to the
household, and a number of Molokai chiefs, despoiled of their lands by
the king of Oahu, became his retainers. He had carefully trained bands
of musicians and dancers, and his entertainments were frequent and
bountiful.</p>
<p>In the midst of this semi-royal gayety and splendor Kahekili quietly
crossed the mountains and temporarily established his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>court at Wailuku, but a few miles from Waihee.
He had heard of Keeaumoku&rsquo;s royal style of living, and desired to
learn from personal observation whether it was inspired by an innocent
love of display or designs more ambitious. As Keeaumoku had rebelled
against two successive Hawaiian sovereigns, and boldly seized the widow
of a king in the very household of her royal claimant and protector,
Kahekili had reason to regard him with suspicion, and a week&rsquo;s
stay at Wailuku, during which reserved courtesies had been exchanged
between them, convinced him that Keeaumoku was a dangerous subject. But
how was he to be dealt with? He had committed no act of treason, and an
assault upon him would not be sustained by the chiefs.</p>
<p>In this dilemma Kahekili resorted to strategy. He induced Kahanana,
a resolute warrior and subordinate land-holder of Waihee, to embroil
Keeaumoku in a difficulty with his own people. To this end Kahanana
complained&mdash;probably without cause&mdash;that he had been
frequently neglected by the servants of Keeaumoku in the distribution
of fish after fortunate catches, and urged his grievance with so good a
showing of sincerity that many of his friends stood prepared to espouse
his quarrel. This done, he armed himself for battle, and, the following
night, killed three of Keeaumoku&rsquo;s laborers. Being attacked in
return, he was at once supported by a party of warriors secretly
detailed for that purpose by Kahekili, and a general fight resulted,
which lasted in a desultory way for three or four days. In the end,
however, Keeaumoku and his party were overpowered and compelled to seek
safety in flight.</p>
<p>Keeaumoku and Namahana, with her mother and two brothers, and a
considerable following of chiefs and retainers, escaped over the Eka
mountains and embarked for Molokai. But Kahekili was not content with
the escape of Keeaumoku from Maui. He resolved to destroy him, and soon
after invaded Molokai with a large force. Keeaumoku and his allies met
the invaders in war-canoes as they approached the shore. A desperate
sea-fight followed, which was continued long into the night by
torchlight; but Keeaumoku was again defeated, and with difficulty
escaped to Hana with Namahana and her relatives.</p>
<p>This placed Keeaumoku beyond the reach of Kahekili, for that
district of Maui was still under Hawaiian control; but in escaping from
one enemy he was compelled to throw himself upon <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>the
mercy of another. He was hospitably received, however, by Mahihelelima,
the governor of the district, and was so far forgiven by Kalaniopuu as
to be permitted to remain under the protection of the fortress of
Kauwiki, where for some time, in the shaded valleys at the base of
Haleakala, he found a respite new to his turbulent life.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a secluded valley within sight of the fortress of
Kauwiki, with a few devoted friends and attendants, Keeaumoku and his
family lived unmolested and almost unnoticed for several years. It was
a season of peace between Hawaii and Maui, and Keeaumoku spent his days
in dreaming of wars to come, and political changes that would place him
again in a position more consistent with his rank. He made spears and
battle-axes, and laid them away; he constructed canoes and housed them
near the neighboring beach.</p>
<p>He loved his wife, who was content to share his exile, and when, in
1768, a daughter was born to him, Keeaumoku felt that the gods were
smiling upon him once more, and took courage. It is said that the child
was born with a yellow feather in her hand&mdash;a symbol of
royalty&mdash;and she was named Kaahumanu and tenderly cared for.</p>
<p>In 1775 Kalaniopuu, king of Hawaii, suddenly appeared in the
district of Hana with a considerable force, and began to ravage the
neighboring lands of Kaupo. Kahekili promptly met and repulsed him,
however, and he returned to Hana and abandoned the campaign by
re-embarking with his shattered army for Hawaii. Keeaumoku took no part
in the brief struggle, and was disappointed that nothing decisive had
been accomplished. The death of either of the two sovereigns engaged
would have been to him a signal of deliverance. But he was not
disheartened. He knew the war would soon be resumed on a grander scale,
and found partial contentment in the hope that it would result in
changes favorable to his fortunes.</p>
<p>Exasperated at his defeat, Kalaniopuu spent nearly two years in
preparing for a crushing invasion of Maui. In honor of his war-god,
<i>Kaili</i>, he repaired and put in order two <i>heiaus</i>, and
instructed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name=
"pb359">359</a>]</span>his high-priest, Holoae, to maintain continuous
religious services, and exert his highest powers to accomplish the
defeat and death of Kahekili. He landed with six heavy divisions of
warriors on the southern coast of Maui, but was defeated with great
slaughter in the neighborhood of Wailuku, and compelled to sue for
peace. With him were the two brothers of Keeaumoku, Kameeiamoku and
Kamanawa, who attended the young Prince Kiwalao in his visit of
conciliation to Kahekili after the battle.</p>
<p>Kalaniopuu returned to Hawaii with what remained of his army, and
the next year again invaded Maui, and for several months carried on a
desultory warfare with Kahekili in the several districts of the island.
He was assisted by the governor of Hana, and was able for some time to
maintain a foothold in Hamakualoa and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Keeaumoku offered his services to neither side, but remained a quiet
and almost unobserved spectator of the hostile movements which at
intervals convulsed the island, and sometimes swept past the very door
of his exile home in Hana. The proper time for him to act had not yet
arrived, and years of solitude had schooled him to patience.</p>
<p>It was during this campaign that Captain Cook, the celebrated
English explorer, arrived off the coast of Maui with the two vessels
under his command, exhibiting faces that were new to the natives, and
ships which seemed to be the ocean palaces of their gods. This was in
November, 1778. In January of that year Cook had touched the group for
the first time. He had landed at Kauai and Niihau, and had now returned
from the Arctic seas to winter among the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>Abandoning the fruitless war, Kalaniopuu returned to Hawaii with his
invading army. During the campaign of the year before he had been
assisted to the extent of a battalion of warriors by Kahahana, king of
Oahu. Among the followers of the Oahuan <i>moi</i> at that time was the
celebrated poet and prophet Keaulumoku. He was a native of Naohaku, in
the Hamakua district of Hawaii, and was distantly related to Kahekili,
being a son of a cousin of Kekaulike, the father of Kahekili. From his
youth he was dreamy and psychologic, and spent his time in roaming
among the hills, watching the stars and listening to the music of the
ocean. Some years before he had become attached to the court of
Kahahana, and had followed that sovereign to Maui in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>1777. He remained on the island after the return
of Kahahana to Oahu, and the year following, when Kalaniopuu again
invaded Maui, the poet was found among his household.</p>
<div class="figure p360width" id="p360"><img src="images/p360.jpg" alt=

<p class="first">(FROM A PAINTING IN THE ROYAL PALACE.)</p>
</div>
<p>Although but sixty-two years of age, in appearance Keaulumoku was
much older. His eyes were bright, but his form was bent, and his white
hair and beard swept his shoulders. When he sang all listened, and his
wild utterances were treasured up and repeated as inspirations from the
gods. He was known on all the islands of the group, and it was safe for
him to travel anywhere. He had been a friend of Keeaumoku, many years
before, on Hawaii, and when he learned, during the campaign of 1778,
that the unfortunate chief was an exile in Hana and had ceased to be
accounted among the leaders of the time, he resolved to visit and
console him.</p>
<p>Without making his purpose known to any one, Keaulumoku crossed the
mountains, and, the third day, stood before his friend in Hana. Their
greeting was affectionate, and after eating they sat down and wailed
over Keeaumoku&rsquo;s misfortunes. Then Namahana came with stately
grace to welcome the old poet, bringing with her Kaahumanu, who was
then a bright-eyed child of ten. He kissed the hand of Namahana,
advising her to be of good cheer, and, embracing the child and looking
into her eyes, told her that his dreams that night should be of her.
And so they were, for the next morning he solemnly sang in the shade of
the palms that Kaahumanu would be loved by a chief of renown and become
the wife of a king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of her father?&rdquo; inquired Keeaumoku. &ldquo;Is
he to rot with his spears in Hana?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the poet, promptly. &ldquo;The great work
of Keeaumoku&rsquo;s life is still before him. He will become the
slayer of princes and maker of kings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One have I already helped to royal honors,&rdquo; returned
the chief, doubtingly, &ldquo;and by his favor I am stifling here in
Hana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another and a greater is still to follow, in whose service
Keeaumoku will die in peace,&rdquo; answered the poet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the coming hero?&rdquo; inquired the chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not mistake him when you meet,&rdquo; was the
evasive reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when will that be?&rdquo; ventured Keeaumoku.</p>
<p>No reply being made, the chief continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no matter when; I have learned to be patient!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361" name=
"pb361">361</a>]</span></p>
<p>The predictions of the poet extended no farther; but his words
cheered the heart of Keeaumoku, and when he left for Lahaina the next
day, grateful eyes followed his footsteps far into the mountains.</p>
<p>Returning to Hawaii after his unsuccessful campaign of 1778,
Kalaniopuu remained for a time in Kona, and after the death of Captain
Cook, in February, 1779, removed his court to Kohala, taking with him
the poet Keaulumoku. The next year, feeling his end
approaching&mdash;for he was nearly eighty years of
age&mdash;Kalaniopuu set his kingdom in order by proclaiming his son
Kiwalao as his successor, and naming his nephew, Kamehameha, as the
custodian of his war-god. He then put down the rebellion of Imakakaloa
in Kau, and, after changing residences two or three times for his
health, finally died at Kailikii, in January, 1782.</p>
<p>A few months before the death of Kalaniopuu, Kahekili, learning of
the failing health of his old opponent, prepared for the recovery of
the district of Hana, which had been for nearly forty years under
Hawaiian rule. Marching into the district and investing the fortress of
Kauwiki, he finally reduced it by cutting off its water-supply, and
Eastern Maui again became a part of the dominions of the <i>moi</i> of
Maui. This occurred about the time of the death of Kalaniopuu.</p>
<p>But what became of Keeaumoku and his family, whose home for years
had been among the hills of Hana? Learning of the meditated invasion of
the district, and unwilling to trust himself to the mercy of Kahekili,
Keeaumoku fled with his family to the almost barren island of
Kahoolawe, where he lived in seclusion until after the fall of Kauwiki
and death of Kalaniopuu, when he boldly returned to Hawaii, quietly
settled on his old and inalienable estates at Kapalilua, in South Kona,
and awaited the development of events, which he plainly perceived were
rapidly and irresistibly tending toward wide-spread revolution and
disorder. For more than fifteen years he had heard the clash of arms
only at a distance, and he yearned for the shouts of battle and the
music of marching columns.</p>
<p>The mourning for Kalaniopuu continued for many weeks, and rumors
unsatisfactory to the Kona chiefs were afloat concerning the new
<i>moi&rsquo;s</i> proposed division of the lands subject to royal
apportionment. Preparations for the burial of the bones of the deceased
king were finally completed. In double canoes, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name="pb362">362</a>]</span>one
of them bearing the corpse of his royal father, Kiwalao set sail with a
large party of chiefs, warriors and retainers for Honaunau. There it
was his purpose to deposit the remains in the neighboring burial-place
of <i>Hale-a-Keawe</i>, sacred to the ashes of Hawaiian kings, and then
proceed with the redivision of such of the lands of the kingdom as were
at his disposal.</p>
<p>When off Honokua the second day, Keeaumoku came down from Kapalilua
and boarded the fleet. His avowed purpose was to wail over the body of
Kalaniopuu. His return to Hawaii had become generally known, and
Kiwalao regarded with a curiosity not unmixed with suspicion the
warring and impetuous chief, who had been first the friend and then the
enemy of his father, and who had suddenly emerged at a critical moment
full-armed from the obscurity of years.</p>
<p>What was the object of Keeaumoku&rsquo;s visit to the mourning
fleet? Was he anxious, on the eve of stirring events, to behold the
face of the young king, remembering the words of Keaulumoku, &ldquo;You
will know him when you meet&rdquo;? Perhaps. But, whatever may have
been his original purpose in visiting the fleet, when he left, in
keeping with the turbulent instincts of his life, his thoughts were
aglow with projects of rebellion.</p>
<p>Hastening to Kehaha, where his brothers, Kameeiamoku and Kamanawa,
with Kamehameha, Kekuhaupio and other chiefs, were in council,
Keeaumoku informed them that the destination of Kiwalao was Kailua,
which place he would proceed to occupy after depositing the royal
remains at Honaunau. This information, he declared, was given to him by
one of Kiwalao&rsquo;s attendants.</p>
<p>Not doubting the truth of Keeaumoku&rsquo;s story, and believing it
to be the purpose of Kiwalao to occupy the entire district of Kona,
which embraced lands not subject to royal disposal, the assembled
chiefs moved with their followers and occupied quarters in the
neighborhood of Honaunau.</p>
<p>Keeaumoku now became a leading spirit in the events which rapidly
followed. The funeral cortege landed at Honaunau, the remains of the
dead king were ceremoniously entombed at <i>Hale-a-Keawe</i>, and
Kiwalao ascended a platform, and to the assembled chiefs proclaimed the
will of his father. In the divisions of lands that followed the Kona
chiefs were not consulted; nor does it appear that they were
additionally provided for, and Keeaumoku <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb363" href="#pb363" name="pb363">363</a>]</span>had little difficulty
in persuading them that they had been treated with intended disrespect
and hostility.</p>
<p>In an interview with Kiwalao, Kamehameha was coolly received, and
the disaffected chiefs began to prepare for battle. They selected
Kamehameha as their leader, and for some days there was a vigorous
mustering of forces on both sides. An attack was finally made by the
rebellious chiefs, and a battle of some magnitude ensued. Keeaumoku was
again in his element. His voice was heard above the din of battle, and
his famished weapons drank their fill of blood. Entangled with his
spear, he fell upon the rocky ground. Several warriors rushed upon him.
Two of them attacked him with daggers, while a third struck him in the
back with a spear, exclaiming, &ldquo;The spear has pierced the
yellow-backed crab!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kiwalao, not far distant, witnessed the encounter, and called to the
assailants of Keeaumoku to secure his <i>palaoa</i>, or ivory neck
ornament. The attention of Kamanawa was attracted to the struggle, and
he sprang with a few followers to the assistance of his brother,
driving back his assailants. At that moment Kiwalao was struck in the
temple with a stone, and fell stunned to the ground. Observing the
circumstance, Keeaumoku crawled to the fallen king, and, with a knife
edged with sharks&rsquo; teeth, cut his throat.</p>
<p>With the death of Kiwalao the rout of his army became general. The
victory made Kamehameha master of the districts of Kona, Kohala and
Hamakua, while Keoua, the brother of Kiwalao, held possession of Kau
and Puna, and Keawemauhili declared himself independent of both in
Hilo.</p>
<p>Keeaumoku&rsquo;s brilliant part in this first of the battles of the
period for the sovereignty of Hawaii established him at once in the
favor of Kamehameha, and raised him high in the esteem of the
distinguished chiefs whose valor ennobled the closing years of barbaric
supremacy in the group.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">War soon occurred between Kamehameha and the
independent chiefs of Hilo and Kau, but, as no marked advantages to
either side resulted, Kamehameha established his court at Halaula,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span>in Kohala, and occupied himself in improving the
condition of his people. During the campaign he had met with some
reverses, but Keeaumoku&rsquo;s faith in the final triumph of his great
leader remained unshaken through every disaster. He thought he saw in
him that captain, greater than Kalaniopuu, of whom the poet dreamed in
Hana, and was soon after confirmed in the belief by the definite
prophecy of Keaulumoku.</p>
<p>Restlessly roaming from place to place, the old singer finally
selected a temporary abode near Halaula, shortly after the removal of
the court of Kamehameha to that village. There he was frequently
visited by Keeaumoku, sometimes accompanied by Kaahumanu, who was
budding into an attractive womanhood, and sometimes by Namahana, who
regarded him with a reverence due to one whose utterances seemed to be
inspired by the gods.</p>
<p>Since the death of Kalaniopuu the voice of Keaulumoku had been
silent. He mourned over the distracted condition of the island, and
sympathized with the people in their enforced warfare with each other.
Vainly had he sought to penetrate the mists of desolation and disorder,
and catch a glimpse of what was beyond. No light had come to him
through the clouds; to his prayers no answering voice had whispered in
his dreams.</p>
<p>But the curtain was raised for him at last, and, as the shades of
the future trooped before him in awful pantomime, in a voice wild as
the winds sweeping through the gorge of Nuuanu he chanted the prophetic
<i>mele</i> of <i>Hau-i-Kalani</i>. After describing the horrors of the
civil war then desolating the island, he concluded by predicting that
Kamehameha would triumph over his enemies, and in the end be hailed as
the greatest of Hawaiian conquerors.</p>
<p>The chant created great enthusiasm among the followers of
Kamehameha. Keeaumoku listened to it with rapt attention, and at its
conclusion stooped over the old poet and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked you a question in Hana, which you did not answer
then. Is it answered now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keaulumoku looked into the face of the chief for a moment as if to
collect his thoughts, and then dreamily replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is answered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such was my thought,&rdquo; returned the chief. &ldquo;I have
some rare dainties from the sea. Come and eat with me to-night, and I
will ask to be taught the <i>mele</i> you have just chanted.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name=
"pb365">365</a>]</span></p>
<p>Keaulumoku made no reply, and Keeaumoku walked slowly toward the
palace, trying to remember the words of the poet which had so thrilled
his listeners.</p>
<p>What occurred between Keeaumoku and the old poet during their repast
that evening will never be known; but certain it is that henceforth
Keeaumoku never doubted the final success of Kamehameha, and when, in
the summer of 1785, the latter retired discomfited from an invasion of
Hilo, Keeaumoku smiled as he said to his chief: &ldquo;Thus far you
have only skirmished with your enemies; you will win when you fight
battles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1784 Keaulumoku died. For months the old poet had lived alone in
a hut near Kauhola. He avoided company and seldom spoke to any one.
Feeling his end approaching, he one day announced that the evening
following he would chant his last <i>mele</i>. Hundreds collected
around his hut at the time appointed. They did not enter, but sat down,
conversing in whispers, and respectfully waited.</p>
<p>An hour passed, and another, but the old singer did not make his
appearance. Finally the mat which served as a door was drawn aside, and
Keaulumoku&rsquo;s white head and bent form were seen in the opening.
Seating himself within view of all, he began to chant a <i>mele</i> in
tremulous tones. As he proceeded his voice became louder, and every
word was breathlessly listened to. He spoke of the coming conquest of
the group by Kamehameha, whom he designated as the son of Kahekili, and
also as &ldquo;the lone one.&rdquo; He also predicted the early
extinction of the Kamehameha dynasty, the domination of the white race,
the destruction of the temples, and finally the gradual death of the
Hawaiian people. Concluding his chant, the old seer raised his hands as
if to bless his listeners, and fell back dead. A great wail went up
from the people, and they tenderly bore the body of the dead poet to
the <i>heiau</i>, where it was accorded the burial rites of a
prophet.</p>
<p>Much of the last prophecy of Keaulumoku was preserved and repeated,
and by conversing with the many who listened to it Keeaumoku managed to
secure a satisfactory version of the final song of the dying poet.</p>
<p>From the first of Kamehameha&rsquo;s battles Keeaumoku had not
doubted the triumph of that chief over all adversaries in the end, and
eagerly grasped at every circumstance calculated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name="pb366">366</a>]</span>to
strengthen the conviction. So believing, his way seemed to be
clear.</p>
<p>But what of Kaahumanu, whose promised lover was to be a chief of
renown, and whose husband was to be a king? She was an attractive
maiden of seventeen, and a few months after the death of Keaulumoku,
and while Kamehameha was engaged in peaceful pursuits at Halaula, her
father suddenly brought her to court. Fresh, sparkling and graceful,
and related to the royal lines of Maui and Hawaii, she attracted the
immediate attention of Kamehameha, and he disposed of the claims of her
many suitors at once by making her his wife.</p>
<p>There was little in the appearance of the great chief to please the
eye of a girl of seventeen. His features were rugged and irregular, and
he held in contempt the courtly graces which imparted a charm to the
intercourse with each other of the nobility of the time. He was already
the husband of two recognized wives; but Kaahumanu was ambitious, and,
with admiration but no affection for him, she consented to become his
wife.</p>
<p>Keeaumoku was now persistent in inspiring Kamehameha with the
thought of becoming the master of the group. He recited to him the
prophetic chants of Keaulumoku, and brought to him the favoring
auguries of the <i>kaulas</i>.</p>
<p>An unsuccessful attempt to recover the district of Hana in 1786 was
followed in 1790 by another invasion of Maui, when Kamehameha
completely subjugated the island, and then turned his attention to
Keoua, the independent chief of Kau, who had slain the chief of Hilo
and assumed the sovereignty of the southern districts of Hawaii.</p>
<p>The war with Keoua continued for more than a year, and every effort
of Kamehameha to crush this last of his rivals on Hawaii was
successfully resisted. For nine years Keoua had maintained himself
against the power of Kamehameha, and still remained master of Kau and
the most of Puna. Treachery was finally resorted to, and Keoua
fell.</p>
<p>The old temple of Puukohola had been partially rebuilt, and a noted
seer had predicted that its completion would give to Kamehameha the
undisputed sovereignty of Hawaii. The temple was hastily finished, and
Keoua was invited to a conference with his opponent at Kawaihae, with
the view, he was led to believe, of peacefully settling their
differences. Nearing the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href=
"#pb367" name="pb367">367</a>]</span>shore of the place of meeting,
where he saw and exchanged greetings with Kamehameha, he was about to
land when Keeaumoku met him in a canoe and treacherously assassinated
him, and his body was taken to the newly-completed temple and
sacrificed to the war-god of his betrayer.</p>
<p>Keoua was a brave, noble, and magnanimous chief, and the apologists
of Kamehameha have not succeeded in relieving him from the odium of
Keeaumoku&rsquo;s cowardly act. He was the half-brother of Kiwalao, and
his death left Kamehameha the master of Hawaii.</p>
<p>Truly, as predicted by the seer, had Keeaumoku become the slayer of
princes and the maker of kings. But his work was not yet completed.
Kamehameha was the sovereign of Hawaii, but the conquest of the group
was still before him. Every circumstance, however, conspired in his
favor. Kahekili, the warlike king of Maui and conqueror of Oahu, died
in 1794, and a rupture had occurred between his successor and Kaeo, the
<i>moi</i> of Kauai.</p>
<p>Everything being in readiness, early in 1795 Kamehameha invaded Oahu
with a mighty army, defeated and subsequently captured and sacrificed
to his war-god King Kalanikupule, and shortly after received the
submission of the <i>moi</i> of Kauai&mdash;thus becoming the
acknowledged master of, and for the first time in their history
consolidating under one government, the several islands of the Hawaiian
group.</p>
<p>The prophecies of Keaulumoku have all been fulfilled. Keeaumoku, the
slayer of princes and maker of kings, died peacefully as governor of
the windward islands in 1804. Kaahumanu became the wife of a king, and
died as chief counsellor of the islands in 1832. The temples of the
Hawaiian gods were destroyed immediately after the death of Kamehameha,
in 1819, and but a tenth of the number of natives found on the islands
at the close of the last century are now left to sing of the
achievements of their ancestors, who first made their home in the group
when the Roman Empire was falling to pieces under the assaults of
Northern barbarism. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369"

<p class="first">Although barbarous to the extent to which a brave,
warm-hearted and hospitable people were capable of becoming, every
social, political and religious circumstance preserved by tradition
tends to show that at no period of their history did the Polynesians
proper&mdash;or the Hawaiian branch of the race, at
least&mdash;practise cannibalism. In their migrations from the southern
coasts of Asia to their final homes in the Pacific, stopping, as they
did, at various groups of islands in their voluntary or compulsory
journeyings, the Polynesians must have been brought in contact with
cannibal tribes; but no example ever persuaded them into the habit of
eating human flesh, or of regarding the appetite for it with a feeling
other than that of aversion and disgust. In offering a human sacrifice
it was customary for the officiating priest to remove the left eye of
the victim after the lifeless body had been deposited upon the altar,
and present it to the chief, who made a semblance of eating it. Even as
learned and conscientious an inquirer as Judge Fornander has suggested
that this custom was possibly the relic of a cannibal propensity
existing among the Polynesian people far back in the past. The
assumption is quite as reasonable that the rite was either a simple
exhibition of bravado, or the expression of a desire on the part of the
chief to thereby more strictly identify himself with the offering in
the eyes of the gods.</p>
<p>Several traditions have come down the centuries referring to the
existence of cannibal tribes or bands at one time or another in the
Hawaiian archipelago, particularly on the islands of Oahu and Kauai,
and harrowing stories of their exploits are a part of the folk-lore of
the group. But in every instance the man-eaters are spoken of as
foreigners, who came from a land unknown, maintained local footholds
for brief seasons in mountain fastnesses, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb372" href="#pb372" name="pb372">372</a>]</span>and in the end were
either exterminated or driven from the islands by the people for their
barbarous practices. It is difficult to fix, even approximately, the
period of the earlier of these occurrences, as they are mentioned in
connection with ruling chiefs whose names do not appear in the
chronological <i>meles</i> surviving the destruction of the ancient
priesthood. Instead of being foreigners, it is not improbable that the
cannibals referred to in some of the traditions were the remnants of a
race of savages found on one or more of the islands of the group when
the first of the Polynesians landed there. This, it may be presumed,
was somewhere near the middle of the fifth century of the Christian
era.</p>
<p>It has generally been assumed by native historians that the
ancestors of the Hawaiian people found the entire group uninhabited at
the time of their arrival there. The bird, the lizard and the mouse,
with an insect life confined to few varieties, were the sole occupants
of that ocean paradise, with its beautiful streams, its inviting hills,
its sandal forests, its cocoa and <i>ohia</i> groves, its flowering
plains, its smiling valleys of everlasting green. But the interval
between the fifth century and the eleventh&mdash;between the first and
second periods of Polynesian arrival&mdash;is a broad blank in the
legendary annals of Hawaii, and the absence of any record of the
circumstance cannot be satisfactorily accepted as evidence that, on
arriving at the group from the southern islands, the Polynesians of the
fifth century did not find it sparsely occupied by an inferior and less
capable people, whom they either affiliated with or destroyed. In some
of the <i>meles</i> vague references are made to such a people, and
ruins of temples are still pointed out as the work of the
<i>Menehunes</i>&mdash;a half-mythical race or tribe, either from whom
the Hawaiians descended, or with whom they were in some manner
connected in the remote past.</p>
<p>To whatever period, however, many of these stories of cannibalism
may refer, circumstances tend to show that the legends connected with
the man-eaters of Halemanu are based upon events of comparatively
recent centuries. The natives, who still relate fragments of these
legends to those whom curiosity prompts to visit the cannibals&rsquo;
retreat near the northern coast of Oahu, generally refer the adventures
described to the early part or middle of the eighteenth century, and a
half-caste of intelligence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href=
"#pb373" name="pb373">373</a>]</span>informed the writer that his
grandfather had personal knowledge of the cannibal band. Although the
sharpness of the details preserved indicates that their beginning could
not have been very many generations back, the occupation of Halemanu by
Aikanaka and his savage followers could have occurred scarcely later
than the latter part of the seventeenth century&mdash;probably during
the reign of Kualii or his immediate successor, somewhere between the
years 1660 and 1695. At that time Oahu was governed by a number of
practically independent chiefs, whose nominal head was the governing
<i>alii-nui</i> of the line of Kakuhihewa, of whom Kualii was the
great-grandson.</p>
<p>It will therefore be assumed that it was near the close of the
seventeenth century that Kalo Aikanaka, with two or three hundred
followers, including women and children, landed at Waialua, on the
northern coast of Oahu, and temporarily established himself on the
sea-shore not far from that place. Ten years before, more or less, he
had arrived with a considerable party at Kauai from one of the southern
islands&mdash;which one tradition does not mention. The strangers came
in double canoes, and, as they were in a starving condition, it was
thought that they had been blown thither by adverse winds while
journeying to some other islands. They were hospitably received and
cared for by the people of Kauai, and for their support were given
lands near the foot of the mountains back of Waimea. In complexion they
were somewhat darker than the Kauaians, but otherwise did not differ
greatly from them either in dress, manners, modes of living or
appearance. They knew how to weave mats, construct houses of timber and
thatch, make spears and knives, and hollow out canoes of all
dimensions. They were familiar with the cocoanut and its uses, and
required no instruction in the cultivation of <i>kalo</i> or
<i>taro</i>. They were expert fishermen, and handled their weapons with
dexterity. Their language, however, was entirely different from that of
the Kauaians; but they soon acquired a knowledge of the latter, and in
a short time could scarcely be distinguished from the natives of the
island.</p>
<p>Although known as Kalo Aikanaka by the natives, the real name of the
chief of the strangers was Kokoa. The name of his principal lieutenant
or adviser, which is given as Kaaokeewe by tradition, was Lotu, or
Lotua. Kokoa was of chiefly proportions, and his muscular limbs were
tattooed with rude representations of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb374" href="#pb374" name="pb374">374</a>]</span>birds, sharks and
other fishes. His features were rather of the Papuan cast, but his hair
was straight, and the expression of his face was not unpleasant. The
appearance of Lotu, on the contrary, was savage and forbidding. His
strength was prodigious, and he made but little disguise of his lawless
instincts. The wife of Kokoa had died during the passage to Kauai,
leaving with him a daughter of marriageable age named Palua. Tradition
says she was very beautiful, and wore necklaces and anklets of pearls.
Her eyes were bright, her teeth were white, and the ends of her braided
hair touched her brown ankles as she walked. Lotu was married, but
without children. He did not like them, and more than one, it is said,
had been taken from the breast of Kaholekua and strangled.</p>
<p>The strangers brought with them two or three gods, and made others
after their arrival. They knew nothing of the gods of the Kauaians, and
preferred to worship their own. To this the natives did not object; but
in the course of time they discovered that their <i>tabu</i> customs,
even the most sacred, were not observed by the strangers. Their women
were permitted to eat cocoanuts, bananas, and all kinds of flesh and
fish, including the varieties of which native females were not allowed
to partake. Fearing the wrath of the gods, the chief of the district
visited Kokoa and requested him to put a stop to these pernicious
practices among his people. He promised to do so, and for a time they
ceased; but the offenders soon fell back into their old habit of
indiscriminate eating, and the chief again visited Kokoa, prepared to
put his previous request into the form of an order. The order was
given, but not with the emphasis designed by the chief in making the
visit, for he then met Palua for the first time, and found it difficult
to speak harshly to the father of such a daughter. In fact, before he
left the chief thought it well to leave the matter open for further
explanation, and the next day returned to make it, and to ask Kokoa, as
well, to give him the beautiful Palua for a wife. Father and daughter
both consented, and within a few days Palua accompanied the chief home
as his wife. There, at least, it was expected that Palua would respect
the <i>tabus</i> she had violated before her coming, and the chief
appointed a woman to instruct her thoroughly in the regulations
applicable to her changed condition. She promised everything, but
secretly complied with no requirement. The chief implored her to obey
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name=
"pb375">375</a>]</span>the mandates of the gods, and sought to screen
her acts from the eyes of others; but her misdemeanors became so
flagrant that they at last came to the knowledge of the high-priest,
and her life was demanded. Her husband would have returned Palua to her
father, but the priest declared that her offences had been so wanton
and persistent that the gods would be satisfied with nothing short of
her death, and she was therefore strangled and thrown into the sea.</p>
<p>Learning of the death of his daughter, Kokoa in his rage slew a near
kinsman of the chief and made a feast of his body, to the great delight
of his followers. They were cannibals, but the fact was not known to
their neighbors, as they had thus far restrained their appetites for
human flesh, and avoided all mention to others of their propensity for
such food. Their relish for it, however, was revived by the feast
provided by the wrath of Kokoa, and they were not sorry to leave the
lands they had been for some time cultivating back of Waimea, and find
a home in the neighboring mountains, where they could indulge their
savage tastes without restraint.</p>
<p>Locating in a secluded valley in the mountains of Haupu, Kokoa and
his people remained there for several years. They cultivated
<i>taro</i> and other vegetables, and for their meat depended upon such
natives as they were able to capture in out-of-the-way places and drag
to their ovens. Suspected of cannibalism, they were finally detected in
the act of roasting a victim. Great indignation and excitement followed
this discovery, and the chief of the district called for warriors to
assist him in exterminating the man-eaters. But Kokoa did not wait for
a hostile visit. His spies informed him of what was occurring in the
valleys below, and he hastily dropped down to the opposite coast,
seized a number of canoes at night, and with his followers immediately
set sail for Oahu. The party first landed at Kawailoa; but a Kauaian on
a visit to that place recognized one of their canoes as the property of
his brother, and was about to appeal to the local chief, when they
suddenly re-embarked and coasted around the island to Waialua, where
they found a convenient landing and concluded to remain. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We now come to the final exploits of Kokoa and his
clan in Oahu. It is probable that they did not remain long in the
immediate neighborhood of Waialua, where the people were numerous and
unoccupied lands were scarce. Sending their scouts into the mountains
in search of a safe and uninhabited retreat, one of exceptional
advantages was found in the range east of Waialua, some eight or ten
miles from the coast, and thither they removed. The spot selected has
since been known as Halemanu. Before that time it was probably without
any particular name. It is a crescent-shaped plateau of two or three
hundred acres, completely surrounded by deep and almost precipitous
ravines, with the exception of a narrow isthmus, scarcely wide enough
for a carriage-way, connecting it with a broad area of timberless
table-land stretching downward toward the sea.</p>
<p>Nature could scarcely have devised a place better fitted for
defence, and Kokoa resolved to permanently locate there. Near the
middle of the plateau he erected a temple, with stone walls two hundred
feet by sixty, and twenty feet in height. This structure was also
designed as a citadel, to be used in emergencies. About fifty paces
from the temple was the <i>hale</i> of the chief&mdash;a stone building
of the dimensions of perhaps fifty feet by forty. It was divided into
three rooms by wicker partitions, and roofed with stout poles and
thatch. Between this building and the temple was a large excavated
oven, with a capacity for roasting four or five human bodies at the
same time, and a few paces to the westward was the great
carving-platter of Kokoa. This was a slightly basin-shaped stone rising
a foot or more above the surface, and having a superfice of perhaps six
by four feet. A little hewing here and there transformed it into a
convenient carving-table, from which hundreds of human bodies were
apportioned to his followers by Kokoa, who reserved for himself the
hearts and livers, as delicacies to which his rank entitled him. The
lines of the buildings described may still be traced among the tall
grass, and the oily-appearing surface of the carving-table, known as
&ldquo;Kalo&rsquo;s <i>ipukai</i>&rdquo; bears testimony to this day to
the use made of it by the cannibals of Halemanu. The platter is now
almost level with the surface of the ground, and its rim has been
chipped down by relic-hunters, but time <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb377" href="#pb377" name="pb377">377</a>]</span>and the spoliations
of the curious have not materially changed its shape.</p>
<p>Having provided the plateau with these conveniences and the huts
necessary to accommodate his people, Kokoa next put the place in a
condition for defence by cutting the tops of the exposed slopes leading
to it into perpendicular declivities, and erecting a strong building
covering the width and almost entire length of the narrow back-bone
connecting it with the plain below. There was then no means of reaching
the plateau except by a path zigzagging down the upper side to the
timbered gulches beyond, or by the trail passing directly through the
building occupying the apex of the isthmus.</p>
<p>Of this entrance Lotu, the savage lieutenant of Kokoa, was made the
custodian. And there he sat in all weather, watching for passers, the
most of whom, if acceptable, he found a pretext for slaying and sending
to the great oven of his companions. His almost sleepless watchfulness
was due less to a disposition to serve others than to his merciless
instincts, which found gratification in blood-letting and torture.
Tradition says there was a hideous humor in the manner in which he
dealt with many of his victims. In allowing them to pass he inquired
the objects of their visits either to the plateau or the gulches
beyond. They informed him, perhaps, that they were in quest of
<i>hala</i> leaves, of poles for huts, of wood for surf-boards, of
small trees for spears, or of flints for cutting implements, as the
case may have been. When they returned he examined their burdens
closely, and if aught was found beyond the thing of which they were
specifically in search&mdash;even though so trifling an object as a
walking-staff, or a twig or flower gathered by the way&mdash;he
denounced them as thieves and liars, and slew them on the spot.</p>
<p>In this manner many hundreds of people were slain and eaten; but as
no one ever returned to tell the story of what was transpiring at
Halemanu, the cannibals remained for some time undisturbed. But if
their real character was not known, their isolation and strange conduct
gradually gained for them the reputation of being an evil-minded and
dangerous community, and visitors became so scarce at length that Lotu
found it necessary to drop down into the valleys occasionally in search
of victims. Nor were these expeditions, which demanded great caution,
always successful; and when they failed, Lotu sometimes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name=
"pb378">378</a>]</span>secretly killed and sent to the oven one of his
own people, with faces mutilated beyond recognition. Among these were
all of his own relatives and two of the three brothers of his wife. To
escape the fate of the others, the surviving brother, whose name was
Napopo, fled to Kauai.</p>
<p>In physical strength Napopo was scarcely less formidable than Lotu;
but he was young in years, and lacked both skill and confidence in his
powers. To supply these deficiencies, and prepare himself for a
successful encounter with Lotu, which he resolved to undertake in
revenge for the death of his brothers, he sought the most expert
wrestlers and boxers on Kauai, and learned from them the secrets of
their prowess. He trained himself in running, swimming, leaping,
climbing, and lifting and casting great rocks, until his muscles became
like hard wood, and his equal in strength and agility could with
difficulty be found on all the island. And he skilled himself, also, in
the use of arms. He learned to catch and parry flying spears, and hurl
them with incredible force and precision. From the sling he could throw
a stone larger than a cocoanut, and the battle-axe he readily wielded
with one hand few men were able to swing with two. Having thus
accomplished himself, and still distrustful of his powers, he made the
offer of a canoe nine paces in length to any one who in a trial should
prove to be his master either in feats of strength or the handling of
warlike weapons. Many contested for the prize, but Napopo found a
superior in no one.</p>
<p>During the contests a strong man, with large jaws and a thick neck,
came forward and challenged Napopo to compete with him in lifting heavy
burdens with the teeth. The bystanders were amused at the proposal, and
Napopo was compelled by their remarks and laughter to accept it,
although he regarded it as frivolous. Fastening around his middle a
girdle of cords, he cast himself on the ground and said to the man:
&ldquo;Now with your teeth lift me to the level of your breast.&rdquo;
Stooping and seizing the girdle in his teeth, the man with a great
effort lifted Napopo to the height demanded. The other was then girded
in the same manner. He seemed to be confident of victory, and said to
Napopo, as he threw himself at his feet: &ldquo;You will do well if you
raise me to the level of your knees.&rdquo; Napopo made no reply, but
bent and gathered the girdle well between his teeth, and raised the
body to the height of his loins. &ldquo;Higher!&rdquo; exclaimed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379</a>]</span>the man, thinking the strength of his antagonist
was even then taxed to its utmost; &ldquo;my body is scarcely free from
the ground!&rdquo; He had scarcely uttered these words before Napopo
rose erect, and with a quick motion threw him completely over his head.
Bruised and half-stunned by the fall, the man struggled to his feet,
and, with a look of wonder at Napopo, hurriedly left the place to
escape the jeers of the shouting witnesses of his defeat.</p>
<p>Now confident of his strength and satisfied with his skill, Napopo
returned to Oahu in the canoe which so many had failed to win. Landing
at Waialua, he by some means learned that his sister, Kaholekua, the
wife of Lotu, had been killed by her husband. Arming himself with a
spear and knife of sharks&rsquo; teeth, Napopo proceeded to Halemanu.
Arriving at the house barring the entrance to the stronghold, he was
met at the door by Lotu. Their recognition was cold. The eyes of Lotu
gleamed with satisfaction. No longer intimidated, as in the past,
Napopo paid back the look with a bearing of defiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave your spear and enter,&rdquo; said Lotu, curtly.</p>
<p>Napopo leaned his spear against the house and stepped within,
observing, as he did so, that Lotu in his movements kept within reach
of an axe and javelin lying near the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Kaholekua?&rdquo; inquired Napopo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; replied Lotu, sullenly, pointing toward a
curtain of mats stretched across a corner of the room.</p>
<p>Without a word Napopo stepped to the curtain and drew it aside. He
expected to find his sister dead, if at all, but she was still living,
although lying insensible from wounds which seemed to be mortal. With a
heart swelling with rage and anguish, he closed the curtain and
returned to the door. He could not trust himself to speak, and
therefore silently stepped without, in the hope that Lotu would leave
his weapons and follow him. To this end he stood for a few minutes near
the entrance, as if overwhelmed with grief, when Lotu cautiously
approached the door. Advancing a step farther, Napopo suddenly turned
and seized him before he could reach his weapons, and a desperate
bare-handed struggle followed. Both were giants, and the conflict was
ferocious and deadly. From one side to the other of the narrow isthmus
they battled, biting, tearing, pulling, breaking, with no decided
advantage to either; but the endurance of Napopo was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name=
"pb380">380</a>]</span>greater than that of his older antagonist, and
in the end he was able to inflict injury without receiving dangerous
punishment in return. Both of them were covered with blood, and their
<i>maros</i> had been rent away in the struggle, leaving them perfectly
nude.</p>
<p>Although Napopo had in a measure overpowered his mighty adversary,
he found it difficult to kill him with his naked hands. He could tear
and disfigure his flesh, but was unable to strangle him or break his
spine. He therefore resolved to drag him to the verge of the precipice,
and hurl him over it into the rocky abyss below. Struggling and
fighting, the edge of the gulf was reached, when Lotu suddenly fastened
his arms around his antagonist, and with a howl of desperation plunged
over the brink. Dropping downward to destruction together, Lotu&rsquo;s
head was caught in the fork of a tree near the bottom of the declivity
and torn from the body, and Napopo, clasped in the embrace of the
lifeless but rigid trunk, fell dead and mangled among the rocks of the
ravine still farther down.</p>
<p>Recovering her consciousness during the battle, Kaholekua dragged
herself from the house just in time to witness the descent of the
desperate combatants over the precipice. Approaching the verge, she
uttered a feeble wail of anguish and plunged headlong down the
declivity, her mangled remains lodging within a few paces of those of
her husband and brother.</p>
<p>The conclusion of these tragical scenes was observed by a party from
the plateau above&mdash;one tradition says by Kokoa himself. However
this may be, the cannibal chief concluded that Halemanu was no longer a
desirable retreat, and a few days after crossed the mountains to
Waianae with his remaining followers, and soon thereafter set sail with
them for other lands. What became of the party is not known; but with
their departure ends the latest and most vivid of the several legends
of cannibalism in the Hawaiian archipelago. <span class=

<p class="first">Among the distinguished Hawaiian chiefs connected with
the final conquest and consolidation of the group by Kamehameha the
Great, and standing in the gray dawn of the close of the eighteenth
century, when the islands were rediscovered by Captain Cook and
tradition began to give place to recorded history, was Kaiana-a-Ahaula.
He was one of Kamehameha&rsquo;s greatest captains, and the events of
his life, which closed with his death in the last battle of the
conquest, embrace one of the most interesting periods in Hawaiian
history. After giving to the conqueror his best energies for years, and
faithfully assisting in cementing the foundations of his greatness, he
turned against him on the very eve of final triumph, and perished in
attempting to destroy by a single blow the power he had helped to
create.</p>
<p>What was it that caused Kaiana to turn his spear in hopeless
desperation against his victorious chief, to whom the gods and their
prophets had promised everything? Had not <i>Pele</i> destroyed his
enemies with fire and smoke? and had not Keaulumoku, the inspired bard
of Naohaku, chanted the fadeless glory of his triumphs? The war-god of
Liloa&mdash;the fateful <i>Kaili</i>&mdash;led the van of his
conquering columns, and <i>Kalaipahoa</i>, the poison god of Molokai,
was among the deities of his household. The high-priest Hewahewa, who
traced his sacerdotal line back to Paao, was his mediator in the
temples, and every voice from the <i>anu</i> was a note of
encouragement and promise of victory. The great chiefs of Hawaii were
his friends, and his war-canoes cruised almost unopposed throughout the
eight Hawaiian seas. Musket and cannon had been added to his weapons
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name=
"pb384">384</a>]</span>of war, and white men had enlisted to some
extent in his service. But, with all these advantages and assurances of
success, Kaiana suddenly threw defiance in his face and became his open
enemy.</p>
<p>By some the defection of Kaiana has been attributed to cold-blooded
and unprovoked treachery; by others to an assumption by Kaiana that by
blood Kamehameha was not entitled to the sovereignty of the group, and
that his defeat in Oahu would dispose of his pretensions in that
direction, and possibly open to himself a way to supreme power; and by
still others to the jealousies of Kamehameha, which rendered the life
of Kaiana no longer safe in his service. By these it is claimed that
Kamehameha was jealous, not only of the growing military fame of
Kaiana, but of a suspected regard of his favorite wife, Kaahumanu, for
the handsome and distinguished chief. And this, indeed, as shown by
native and other testimony, seems to have been the leading if not sole
cause of the estrangement between Kamehameha and his great captain.</p>
<p>In the council of chiefs on the island of Molokai, to which Kaiana
was not invited, and which he had reason to believe had decreed his
death, ambition was the crime which Kamehameha imputed to him, when in
truth the real and unmentioned offence was his suspected intimacy with
Kaahumanu. And so it will appear that women&rsquo;s eyes in Hawaii, as
elsewhere, have in all ages swayed the hearts and nerved the arms of
the greatest, and not unfrequently changed the current of vital
political events.</p>
<p>But, before bringing Kaiana full into the light, it is proper that
some reference should be made to the great chief under whose banners he
so stubbornly fought, and against whose authority he finally rebelled;
and in doing so it will be interesting, perhaps, to glance briefly at
certain prominent events connected with the rediscovery of the islands
by Captain Cook, the assumption of the sovereign authority of Hawaii by
Kamehameha, and the final consolidation of the several islands of the
group under one central government.</p>
<p>Kamehameha was a man of tremendous physical and intellectual
strength. In any land and in any age he would have been a leader. The
impress of his mind remains with his crude and vigorous laws, and
wherever he stepped is seen an imperishable track. He was so strong of
limb that ordinary men were but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385"
href="#pb385" name="pb385">385</a>]</span>children in his grasp, and in
council the wisest yielded to his judgment. He seems to have been born
a man and to have had no boyhood. He was always sedate and thoughtful,
and from his earliest years cared for no sport or pastime that was not
manly. He had a harsh and rugged face, less given to smiles than
frowns, but strongly marked with lines indicative of self-reliance and
changeless purpose. He was barbarous, unforgiving and merciless to his
enemies, but just, sagacious and considerate in dealing with his
subjects. He was more feared and admired than loved and respected; but
his strength of arm and force of character well fitted him for the
supreme chieftaincy of the group, and he accomplished what no one else
could have done in his day.</p>
<p>Kamehameha was born at Kohala, Hawaii, in November, 1740. His father
was Keoua, half-brother of Kalaniopuu, and nephew of Alapainui, who was
at that time king of Hawaii. His mother was Kekuiapoiwa, a
granddaughter of Kalanikauleleiaiwi, who was a sister of Keawe, the
previous <i>moi</i> of the island. This sister was the mother of
Alapainui by a chief of the Mahi family of Kohala. With another
husband&mdash;Lonoikahaupu, a <i>tabu</i> chief of Kauai&mdash;she
became the mother of Keawepoepoe, who was the father of Keeaumoku,
Kameeiamoku and Kamanawa, who, with Keawe-a-Heulu, were the principal
chiefs and supporters of Kamehameha in his conquest of the group. By a
Kauai wife Lonoikahaupu became the grandfather of Kaumualii, the last
independent sovereign of Kauai, and grandfather of Kapiolani, the
present queen of the islands.</p>
<p>Keawe, the previous king of Hawaii, had four recognized wives, and
two others whose names have not been preserved by tradition. One of
them was the mother of Ahaula, who was the father of Kaiana. On the
death of Keawe his two elder sons lost their lives in a struggle for
the mastery, and Alapainui, the son of the sister of Keawe, and who
through his father was chief of Kohala, assumed the <i>moiship</i>,
and, after a few battles, peacefully maintained his claim to it. Having
secured the sovereignty of the island, he invited to court the elder
sons of his two deceased half-brothers, and there maintained them until
one of them died and the other rose in rebellion against him. These two
sons were Kalaniopuu, who was king of the island at the time of the
arrival of Captain Cook in 1778, and Keoua, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386" name=
"pb386">386</a>]</span>father of Kamehameha. The mother of these wards
of Alapainui was Kamakaimoku, a chiefess of Oahu. Their fathers having
been brothers, and Kamakaimoku being the mother of both, they bore to
each other the mixed relationship of half-brother and cousin. She also
became the wife of Alapainui, and by him the mother of Manoua, who was
the grandmother of Kekuaokalani, the last distinguished champion of
idolatry in 1819.</p>
<p>To this record of the tangled relationships of the chiefly families
of the group at that period may be added the intimations of tradition
that Peleioholani, a chief of Kauai, was the actual father of
Kalaniopuu, and that Kahekili, the <i>moi</i> of Maui, was the real
father of Kamehameha; and in proof of the latter the acts and
admissions of Kahekili are cited. But these scandals may very properly
be dismissed as the offspring of the hatred and jealousies of later
years.</p>
<p>Kamehameha was born at Kohala while Alapainui was there with his
court, superintending the collection of a mighty fleet for the invasion
of Maui. It was a stormy night, and the first sounds that greeted the
ears of the infant chief were the howling of the winds and the din of
warlike preparations. On the night of its birth the child was stolen
from its mother&rsquo;s side and carried away by Naeole, the chief of
Halawa, and for some days nothing was heard of it. The father searched
and the mother wailed, but the infant could not be found. It was
finally discovered, however, and Naeole, instead of being punished for
the theft, was allowed to keep possession of the child until it was
five years old, when it was taken to the court of Alapainui and there
reared as became a prince. Tradition assigns no reason for the theft of
the child, or for the retention of it for five years by the kidnapper;
but, whatever may have been the reason, it is manifest that
Naeole&rsquo;s offence was considered neither flagrant nor unusual.</p>
<p>When Kamehameha reached the age of twelve or fourteen years, his
father, Keoua, suddenly died, and a suspicion became current that he
had been either poisoned or prayed to death through the instrumentality
of Alapainui. This suspicion seems to have been shared by Kalaniopuu,
and believing, or assuming to believe, that his own life was in danger,
he withdrew from the court and attempted to take with him Kamehameha;
but in this he was frustrated. A fight occurred at Piopio while the
body of Keoua was lying there in state, and Kalaniopuu was driven to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name=
"pb387">387</a>]</span>his war-canoe, in which he escaped. This act
placed him in open revolt against his royal uncle, and he prepared to
sustain it. Forces were hastily gathered on both sides, and after a few
battles, in which Kalaniopuu was generally unsuccessful, he retired to
the district of Kau, and declared himself the independent sovereign of
the southern portion of the island. For some reason Alapainui did not
disturb his rebellious nephew farther, but spent the two remaining
years of his life in Hilo and Waipio, the residence of many of the
ancient <i>mois</i>.</p>
<p>When Alapainui died he was succeeded by his son Keaweopala.
Dissatisfied with his allotment of lands, Keeaumoku, a nephew of the
dead king, rebelled against the new <i>moi</i>, but was defeated and
compelled to seek safety with Kalaniopuu, whom he found already in the
field, intent upon contesting the sovereignty of the island with
Keaweopala. The two joined forces, and met and defeated the royal army
in Kona. Keaweopala was slain in battle, and Kalaniopuu was declared
<i>moi</i> of Hawaii. Young Kamehameha was taken to the court of his
royal uncle, and educated in all the princely accomplishments of the
period.</p>
<p>Although it is probable that Kamehameha took part in some of the
earlier wars of Kalaniopuu, he makes his first prominent appearance in
tradition as a military leader in about 1775, in a battle on Maui,
between Kalaniopuu and Kahekili, the <i>moi</i> of that island, or of
the greater portion of it. Kalaniopuu was defeated, but the conduct of
Kamehameha was notably cool and sagacious. It is reasonable to believe
that he also took part in the disastrous campaign of the following
year, when the army of Kalaniopuu was almost annihilated on the
lowlands near Wailuku.</p>
<p>This battle was one of the most sanguinary spoken of in Hawaiian
tradition. Kalaniopuu invaded the island with six heavy divisions of
warriors of all arms. The members of the royal family were formed into
a life-guard called <i>Keawe</i>, while the nobles entitled to the
privilege of eating at the same table with the king composed two
distinct brigades, known as <i>Alapa</i> and <i>Piipii</i>. A landing
was effected on the southern side of the island. The headquarters of
Kahekili were at Wailuku, between which and the coast stretched a
slightly elevated sandy plain.</p>
<p>The <i>Alapa</i> took the advance, and, without waiting for support,
pushed boldly on toward Wailuku. This brigade was the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name=
"pb388">388</a>]</span>flower of the Hawaiian army. It was composed of
eight hundred men, each one of whom was of noble blood. They were all
large men of nearly equal stature, and their spears were of equal
length<span class="corr" id="xd26e10892" title="Not in source">.</span>
Marching shoulder to shoulder, with feather capes and plumed helmets,
tradition describes their advance as a spectacle such as had never
before been witnessed. But Kahekili was not appalled at the sight. He
permitted them to approach within a mile or more of Wailuku, when he
suddenly precipitated upon them a force of four or five thousand
spears. The battle was a slaughter. The <i>Alapa</i> refused to yield
or retreat, and of the eight hundred helmeted chiefs but two escaped to
tell the tale of the slaughter of their comrades. But a single prisoner
was taken, and he died of his wounds before he could be despatched in
form and offered in sacrifice. It was historic ground. On the sandy
plain many battles had before been fought, and near and above it was
the sacred burial-place of Iao, where had been deposited the bones of
many of the ancestors of the battling chiefs.</p>
<p>The next day a general battle was fought on the same ground, and
Kalaniopuu was defeated. But he was not crushed. The loss of life had
been great on both sides, and a temporary peace was established on the
condition that the Hawaiian army should at once be withdrawn from Maui.
The suspension of hostilities was secured partly through the
instrumentality of the wife of Kalaniopuu, Kalola, who was the full
sister of Kahekili.</p>
<p>But this peace was of short duration. Scarcely a year elapsed before
Kalaniopuu again invaded Maui, where he continued to hold a fortified
possession in Hana, and began to ravage its coasts. Without decisive
results, the campaign extended into months, Kalaniopuu maintaining a
foothold in Hamakualoa, but being unable to extend his conquests
greatly beyond it.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was during the indecisive campaign just referred to
that Captain Cook&mdash;having a few months before touched at Kauai and
Niihau&mdash;returned to the Hawaiian group from the Arctic Ocean, and
anchored off the coast of Maui, where he freely communicated with the
wondering natives, and exchanged courtesies with Kalaniopuu and his
principal chiefs, including Kamehameha. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb389" href="#pb389" name="pb389">389</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is now admitted that the Hawaiian group was first discovered by
Juan Gaetano, a Spanish navigator, in 1555, while on a voyage from the
western coast of Mexico to the Moluccas, or Spice Islands; but the
secret was kept from the world, and the first European to touch at the
islands, to communicate with the natives and make his discovery known,
was Captain Cook.</p>
<p>In the hydrographic bureau of the naval department of the Spanish
government exists an old manuscript chart pretty correctly locating the
group and crediting Gaetano with the discovery. He named the islands
<i>Islas de Mesa</i>, or Table Islands. It is probable that he made a
landing on one of the islands with a few of his crew, since tradition
refers to the sudden appearance of white men at about that period; but
if he did land he left no record of the circumstance, and it is not
shown that he ever returned to the group, or that any of his countrymen
profited by the discovery. It has been claimed that Captain Cook was
directed to the islands by an old Spanish chart of which he had in some
manner become possessed; but his own evidence, as well as that of his
officers, favors the assumption that the rediscovery of the islands by
him was accidental.</p>
<p>Early in December, 1777, Captain Cook, with the British national
ships <i>Resolution</i> and <i>Discovery</i>, left the Society group
for the northwest coast of America. On inquiry the natives of Bolabola
Island informed him that they knew of no lands north or northwest of
them, and it is not probable that he expected to meet with any; but
after a voyage of sixteen days he discovered Christmas Island, and on
the 18th of January, 1778, sighted Oahu, of the Hawaiian group, and to
the northward of it Kauai. He first landed at the latter island, where
he was well received by the natives. He was believed to be their god
<i>Lono</i>, whose return to the group had been promised, and divine
honors were accorded him. His ships were provided with everything they
required, and the fairest women of the island, including the daughter
of the queen, were sent to greet and welcome him.</p>
<p>He next visited Niihau, where he was received in the same hospitable
manner, and on the 2d of February, without visiting the other islands
of the group, proceeded on his voyage toward Behring&rsquo;s Strait in
search of a northwest passage to the Atlantic. The approach of winter
putting an end to further explorations in the north, he returned to the
islands, and on the 26th of November, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb390" href="#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span>1778, sighted Maui,
and the next day his ships were visited by hundreds of natives. The
news of his previous visit to Kauai and Niihau had spread throughout
the group, and he was treated with the greatest friendship and
hospitality.</p>
<p>Three days later, when off the northwest coast of Maui, he was
ceremoniously visited by Kalaniopuu, and six or eight chiefs,
Kamehameha among them, accompanied him almost to Hawaii, when they left
in their canoes, which had been taken in tow, and returned to Maui, to
the great relief of their friends.</p>
<p>Beating around the coasts of Hawaii, it was not until the 17th of
January, 1779, that the vessels came to anchor in Kealakeakua Bay, on
the western side of the island. They were at once crowded with natives,
and the high-priest came aboard, recognized Cook as the god
<i>Lono</i>, and threw over his shoulders the sacred mantle of red. In
the afternoon Cook went ashore, and in a neighboring temple permitted
himself to be publicly and ceremoniously worshipped. Meantime the
vessels were abundantly and gratuitously supplied with pigs, poultry,
fruits and vegetables, and the officers and crews were treated with the
greatest kindness.</p>
<p>On the 24th of January Kalaniopuu returned from Maui, and on the
26th paid the ships a formal visit. The visit was returned, and Cook,
as before, was received on shore with divine honors, against which he
offered no protest. He was placed among the gods in the temple, and
sacrifices were offered to him as one of the Hawaiian Trinity.</p>
<p>How were the devotion and kindness of the simple natives requited?
By eating out the substance of the people, violating the <i>tabus</i>
of the priests and trampling upon the edicts of the king. Cook became
exacting, dictatorial and greedy, and from his conduct it almost seemed
that he began to consider himself in reality the god for whom he was
mistaken by the superstitious natives.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, his departure for the leeward islands of
the group, on the 4th of February, was regarded with satisfaction by
the natives; but the vessels encountered a storm, and on the 11th
returned to Kealakeakua Bay for repairs. Their reception was much less
jubilant than before, and not a canoe went off to greet their return.
However, Kalaniopuu visited the ships the next day, and permitted the
natives to resume intercourse with them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb391" href="#pb391" name="pb391">391</a>]</span></p>
<p>But it was plain that the feelings of the people had undergone a
change. They found that the white strangers had appetites like
themselves, and were just as subject to bodily ills. They also
discovered that they were selfish, unjust and overbearing, and were not
entitled to the consideration with which they had been treated. Petty
bickerings began to occur, and finally a young chief named Palea was
knocked down with a paddle by an English sailor while attempting to
save his canoe from wanton damage.</p>
<p>In retaliation Palea stole a boat from one of the ships. Cook
demanded its restoration, but, as it had been hastily broken up for its
iron nails and fastenings, Kalaniopuu could not, of course, return it.
Thereupon Cook ordered a blockade of the harbor, resulting in the
killing of a prominent chief who attempted to enter it, and then landed
with an armed boat&rsquo;s crew with the view of seizing and holding
the king as security for the return of the missing boat.</p>
<p>Kalaniopuu was in the act of peacefully accompanying Cook to one of
his vessels in the harbor, and had reached a point not far from the
landing, when the brother of the chief who had been killed in
attempting to enter the harbor angrily approached to demand an
explanation. By this time a large crowd of natives had surrounded the
king, and believing, no doubt, that the intentions of the chief were
hostile, Cook drew a pistol and fired upon him, and the next moment
shot and killed a native who had assaulted him with a stone. He also
struck with his sword a chief named Kanaina. The latter seized and held
him.</p>
<p>Believing Cook to be a god, it was not thought that he could be
killed. Struggling to free himself, he must have received a wound from
some quarter, for he sank to the earth with a groan. The groan was
fatal to him. &ldquo;He is not a god! he groans!&rdquo; exclaimed the
people, and without hesitation they slew him at once.</p>
<p>Fire was immediately opened upon the natives from the boat, and
shortly after with cannon from the vessels in the harbor. Consternation
seized the people huddled on the beach. Many were killed, and the most
of the remainder fled to the hills, taking with them the body of Cook.
A party of carpenters and sail-makers, at work some distance away,
became involved in the struggle, but the most of them escaped to the
ships through the kind offices of friendly chiefs. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name="pb392">392</a>]</span></p>
<p>The bones of the unfortunate captain were stripped of their flesh,
as was then the custom, and divided among a few prominent chiefs.
Kamehameha, it is said, received the hair. A few days after, in
response to the request of Captain King, such of the bones as could be
recovered were brought on board the <i>Resolution</i>, by order of
Kalaniopuu, and committed to the deep with military honors. The ships
then left Kealakeakua Bay, and after touching at Oahu, Kauai and
Niihau, finally sailed northward on the 15th of March, leaving behind
them a train of evils which a full century of time has failed to
eradicate.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Abandoning his campaign in Maui, Kalaniopuu, who was
nearly eighty years of age and quite feeble, removed his court to
Kohala after the death of Captain Cook, and subsequently to Waipio,
where he remained for some months. Desiring to settle the succession
while he lived, he called his high chiefs together and proclaimed his
son Kiwalao as his heir and successor in the government and the
supervision of the <i>tabus</i>, and Kamehameha as the custodian of his
war-god <i>Kaili</i>, to which duty the <i>heiau</i> of Moaula, in
Waipio, was formally dedicated after extensive repairs. A temple was
also consecrated to the same god in Hilo.</p>
<p>Shortly after Imakakaloa, who had raised the standard of revolt in
Puna, was captured after a stubborn war and condemned to be sacrificed
at the temple of Pakini. In the absence of Kalaniopuu the performance
of the ceremonies devolved upon Kiwalao. First in order came the
offerings of pigs and fruits, to be followed by the body of the rebel
chief; but while Kiwalao was making the first of the offerings,
Kamehameha seized the body of the chief, offered it in sacrifice and
then dismissed the assembly.</p>
<p>As the sacrifice was to the war-god <i>Kaili</i>, of which he was
the custodian, Kamehameha doubtless claimed and boldly assumed the
right to conduct the ceremonies himself. But the daring act of
insubordination created an intense excitement at the royal court, many
regarding it as little less than rebellion, and Kalaniopuu advised
Kamehameha to retire to Kohala for a season, as he could not answer for
his safety in Waipio. He accepted the advice of his uncle, and, taking
with him his wife <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393"
name="pb393">393</a>]</span>Kalola, his brother Kalaimamahu and the
war-god <i>Kaili</i>, removed to his patrimonial estates at Halawa, in
Kohala, where he remained until the death of Kalaniopuu, which shortly
occurred.</p>
<p>Early in 1782 Kalaniopuu died, and his body was brought to Honaunau
for interment in the sacred burial-place of <i>Hale-a-Keawe</i>.
Fearful that the division of lands which usually followed the
installation of a new <i>moi</i> would not be satisfactory, several
prominent chiefs, among them Kamehameha, repaired to Honaunau to assist
in the interment of the dead king and listen to the proclamation of
Kiwalao. After the body had been deposited Kiwalao ascended a platform
and informed the assembled chiefs that, by the will of his royal
father, the sovereignty of Hawaii had been bequeathed to him, and the
custody of the war-god <i>Kaili</i> to Kamehameha. No other chief was
mentioned as having been provided for, and profound dissatisfaction
followed.</p>
<p>At an <i>awa</i> party in the evening Kiwalao declined to drink of
the <i>awa</i> prepared by Kamehameha, as custom rendered it proper
that he should do. By Kekuhaupio, the aged counsellor of Kamehameha,
the bowl was struck from the hand of another to whom it had been passed
untasted by Kiwalao, and Kamehameha and his friend abruptly left the
house. An open rupture followed the division of lands soon after made,
and Kamehameha was forced to take up arms against Kiwalao by the
disaffected chiefs. He was made their leader, and around him rallied
the chiefs of Kona, Kohala and Hamakua, while Kiwalao was generally
sustained by the chiefs of Hilo, Puna and Kau.</p>
<p>After hasty preparations on both sides a battle was fought at
Hauiki, in which Kiwalao was slain. The royal army was routed, and
Keoua, the half-brother of Kiwalao, fled to Kau, where he declared
himself king of Hawaii, while Keawemauhili, the uncle of the dead king,
who was allowed to escape owing to his extremely high rank, retired to
Hilo and set up an independent government of his own. After the death
of Kiwalao, Keopuolani, his infant daughter, whose mother had fled with
her to Kahekili, <i>moi</i> of Maui, was the only one whom Keawemauhili
was willing to recognize, and three distinct factions began to struggle
for the mastery of the island.</p>
<p>While a desultory warfare was being carried on by the three rival
chiefs of Hawaii, during which Kamehameha was steadily growing in
strength, a new element of military and naval power <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394" name="pb394">394</a>]</span>made
its appearance in the group, and became an important factor in the
political changes that speedily followed. In 1786 the first foreign
vessels, after the departure of the <i>Resolution</i> and
<i>Discovery</i>, touched at the islands, and during the year following
American, English, French, Spanish and Portuguese merchant-men in
considerable numbers visited the group, and the people began to supply
themselves with knives, axes, cloths, beads and other articles of
foreign manufacture, and the chiefs with swords, guns, powder and lead
and other warlike materials. Payment for these articles was made to
some extent in pigs, fowls, fruits and vegetables, but principally in
sandal-wood, in which the mountainous districts of the islands
abounded, and which found a ready market in China. Many deserting
sailors entered the service of the chiefs of Oahu and Hawaii, and to a
less extent of the other islands, and became the instructors of the
natives in the use of fire-arms; and Kamehameha was especially
fortunate in securing the services of Isaac Davis and John Young, who
took an active part in the campaigns of the final conquest. Young
married into a native family of consequence, and became the grandfather
of the late queen-dowager Emma, widow of Kamehameha IV.</p>
<p>In 1790 Kamehameha, during a temporary cessation of hostilities on
Hawaii, invaded Maui with a large force. To the expedition Keawemauhili
had been in some manner induced to contribute a battalion of warriors.
In retaliation for this showing of friendship for Kamehameha, Keoua
invaded Hilo, defeated and killed Keawemauhili, and assumed the
sovereignty of that district. Nor did he stop there. During the absence
of Kamehameha he overran the districts of Hamakua and Kohala, and was
in the act of possessing himself of the whole island when Kamehameha
abruptly left Maui, which he had completely subjugated, and returned to
Hawaii.</p>
<p>Kaiana had been left to guard the district of Kona during the
absence of Kamehameha, and that was the only division left unoccupied
by Keoua. Kamehameha landed with his forces at Kawaihae, and Keoua fell
back with his army to Paauhau. There and at Koapapa a two days&rsquo;
battle was fought, when Keoua retreated to Hilo, and Kamehameha retired
to Waipio to recruit his losses.</p>
<p>Stopping for a few days to divide the lands of the district
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395</a>]</span>among his chiefs, Keoua started on his return to
Kau. His path led by the crater of Kilauea. His army, marching in three
divisions, encamped on the mountains, the central division finding
quarters not far from the crater. Before morning an eruption occurred,
and four hundred warriors were suffocated. This was considered a
special visitation of the wrath of <i>Pele</i>, the goddess of the
volcano, and she was thereafter deemed to be the friend of
Kamehameha.</p>
<p>For a year or more continuous efforts to crush the power of Keoua
were made by Kamehameha. Kaiana operated against him in Kau, and
Keeaumoku in Hilo, but he stubbornly and successfully resisted.
Availing himself of this condition of affairs, Kahekili, <i>moi</i> of
Maui, assisted by Kaeo, king of Kauai, invaded Hawaii, probably for the
purpose of creating a diversion in favor of Keoua, but the combined
armies were driven from the island by Kamehameha.</p>
<p>Keoua, however, remained unsubdued, and Kamehameha resolved at every
sacrifice to crush him, as a preliminary step toward the conquest of
the entire group, which at that time he began to meditate. Some time
before he had sent the grandmother of Kaahumanu to Kauai to consult the
prophets of that island, and word was brought back to him from the
renowned Kapoukahi that if he would rebuild the <i>heiau</i> of
Puukohola and dedicate it to his war-god, he would become the master of
Hawaii. Some work had been done on the temple, and Kamehameha
determined to complete it at once. He therefore ordered large relays of
people from the surrounding districts to repair to Kawaihae and assist
in the building of the <i>heiau</i>. Many thousands responded. With the
exception of Keliimaikai, a brother of Kamehameha, who was left
uncontaminated for the consecration, every chief took part in the
labor, and the temple was soon completed, with sacrifices embracing a
large number of human beings as the work progressed.</p>
<p>Thus was the temple of Puukohola completed, but, pending its formal
consecration, Keawe-a-Heulu and Kamanawa, two of the principal
counselors of Kamehameha, were despatched to Kau under a flag of truce,
to invite Keoua to visit Kamehameha, with the view of arranging terms
of peace. Keoua received the ambassadors kindly, and consented to the
conference. His actions show that he suspected the motives of
Kamehameha, but he resolutely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb396"
href="#pb396" name="pb396">396</a>]</span>accepted the hazard of
placing himself at the mercy of his enemies.</p>
<p>Proceeding in state in a double canoe, Keoua arrived at the landing
of Mailekini, in Kawaihae. Observing Kamehameha on the beach, Keoua
called to him, and was invited to land. Several canoes were around him,
and as he leaped ashore Keeaumoku, from one of them, treacherously
drove a spear through his body, killing him at once. An attack was then
made upon his attendants, and all but two of them were slain. As this,
and many other events noted in this chapter, are briefly referred to in
the legend of &ldquo;The Prophecies of Keaulumoku,&rdquo; it will be
sufficient to mention that the body of Keoua was taken to the temple of
Puukohola, and there sacrificed to <i>Kaili</i> with ample pomp and
ceremony. The possessions of the unfortunate chief passed into the
hands of Kamehameha, who at once became the acknowledged sovereign of
the entire island. This was in 1792.</p>
<p>In Kamehameha&rsquo;s previous campaign against Maui, from which he
had been recalled by the successes of Keoua at home, that island, as
already stated, had been completely subjugated. At the time of the
invasion, Maui, Oahu, Molokai and Lanai were all in the possession of
Kahekili, who had taken up his residence in Oahu, leaving his son
Kalanikupule in charge of Maui. In a single mighty battle on the plains
between East and West Maui, Kamehameha had destroyed the army of
Kalanikupule, who had escaped to Oahu and joined his father, while the
most of the chiefs of Maui had sought refuge on the other islands.</p>
<p>After this victory Kamehameha despatched a messenger to Kahekili,
informing him of his intention to invade Oahu, and the old king
returned to him this answer: &ldquo;Tell Kamehameha to return to
Hawaii, and when the black <i>kapa</i> covers the body of Kahekili the
whole group shall be his.&rdquo; This answer seems to have been hardly
honest, however, for, soon after Kamehameha returned to Hawaii,
Kahekili entered into a combination with Kaeo, king of Kauai, and made
war upon Kamehameha in his own home, with the disastrous results to the
confederates already mentioned.</p>
<p>In 1794 Kahekili died, leaving Kalanikupule as his successor, and a
claimant to the sovereignty of Oahu, Maui, Molokai and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>Lanai. Kaeo, the younger brother and ally of
Kahekili, and who had become the king of Kauai by marrying Queen
Kamakahelei, and had shared in the government of Maui after the
withdrawal of the forces of Kamehameha, concluded to return temporarily
to Kauai after the death of Kahekili. Taking with him a portion of his
army, he first touched at Molokai to collect tribute, and then landed
on Oahu for further supplies. Although his visit was friendly, he met
with opposition from Kalanikupule, and a battle followed, in which Kaeo
was slain.</p>
<p>The Oahu king was assisted by the seamen of two English vessels
lying in the harbor of Honolulu, the <i>Jackal</i> and <i>Prince
Leboo</i>. After the victory a feast was given on board the vessels, to
which the king and a number of his chiefs were invited. Some of the
boats of the vessels, returning from the shore with their crews,
grounded on the reef. Perceiving this, Kalanikupule and his chiefs
seized the vessels, killing their captains and a number of others.
Elated with the possession of these vessels and their armaments, the
king resolved to invade Hawaii. Embarking his army in canoes, he took
passage in one of the vessels, on board of which had been stored the
most of his guns and war materials.</p>
<p>The crews of the vessels had been retained to manage them, and
Kalanikupule sailed out of the harbor in high glee. But he did not
proceed far. After reaching deep water the foreigners sent him and his
attendants back to Waikiki in a boat, and then sailed for Hawaii, where
they delivered Kalanikupule&rsquo;s war supplies to Kamehameha, who was
even then preparing for a descent upon Oahu and the final conquest and
consolidation of the group. This was in the latter part of 1794. The
amount of war material delivered to Kamehameha was not large, but all
of it proved of service to him.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With this somewhat extended reference to Kamehameha
and the prominent chiefs of his time, which brings the tracings of
public events down to the eve of the concluding struggle of the
conquest, we will now return to Kaiana, through whose relations with
Kamehameha some curious glimpses of the domestic life of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398" name="pb398">398</a>]</span>the
latter are brought to view. We have thus far seen him as a warrior. We
will now observe him as a husband, whose peace was disturbed by
jealousies, and whose heart, stern in all things else, was not proof
against the tender influences of love.</p>
<p>At the close of his unsuccessful campaign against the chiefs of Hilo
and Kau, in 1785, Kamehameha took up his residence at Kauhola, where he
devoted himself for a time to more peaceful pursuits. To stimulate his
people to industry he gave his personal attention to agriculture, and
the piece of ground cultivated with his own hands is still pointed out.
Continuous wars had impoverished his possessions, and he was anxious to
restore to productiveness his neglected lands.</p>
<p>Up to this time Kamehameha had two recognized wives, Kalola and
Peleuli. This Kalola was not the widow of Kalaniopuu, although bearing
a similar name. She was a granddaughter of Keawe, king of Hawaii.
Peleuli was the daughter of Kamanawa, brother of Keeaumoku, and one of
his stanchest supporters.</p>
<p>For some months Kamehameha lived quietly at Kauhola. The inspired
song of Keaulumoku, who had died the year before, predicting that he
would become the sovereign of the group, still rang in his ears, and in
the midst of their labors his people were encouraged in the practice of
the manly games and pastimes which added to their strength, skill and
endurance in war. Sham fights on land and sea, and swimming, diving,
wrestling, running and leaping contests, were frequent; and during the
annual feast of <i>Lono</i>, beginning with the winter solstice and
continuing for five days, a tournament was given which brought to
Kauhola the leading chiefs of Hamakua, Kohala and Kona. Among them was
the famous Keeaumoku, who had charge of the district of Kona. He was
accompanied by his family, of which his daughter, Kaahumanu, was the
most attractive feature.</p>
<p>Twenty years before Keeaumoku, who was of the royal line, rebelled
against Kalaniopuu, and was defeated and forced to find refuge on Maui,
whose <i>moi</i>, Kamehamehanui, had died but a few days before,
leaving the government to his brother Kahekili. Keeaumoku, whose
fortunes were desperate, succeeded in captivating and marrying
Namahana, the widow of the deceased king, very much to the chagrin and
disappointment of Kahekili, whose claim to the dowager was sustained by
the royal custom <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399"
name="pb399">399</a>]</span>of the time. A difficulty followed, and
Keeaumoku and his wife took up their residence on the northern side of
the island. But they were not permitted to remain there in peace.
Through the hostility of Kahekili they were driven to Molokai, and
thence to the district of Hana, in eastern Maui, which was then held by
the king of Hawaii, and there, through the mercy of Kalaniopuu, they
were allowed for some years to reside; and there, in 1768, Kaahumanu
was born. On the death of Kalaniopuu, in 1782, Keeaumoku returned to
Hawaii, and in the war for the succession espoused the cause of
Kamehameha and became one of his chief counselors and captains.</p>
<p>Kaahumanu was one of the most attractive women of her time, and
inherited something of the restless and independent spirit of her
warlike father. She was in her eighteenth year when she made her
appearance at the court of Kamehameha, during the festival of
<i>Lono</i>, in 1785. The wives of Kamehameha were well along in years,
Peleuli being the mother of a full-grown son, and Kaahumanu charmed the
great chief with her freshness and independence. His warlike soul
yielded to the fascination, and to win her smile he took part in the
contests of the festival and overcame all competitors. He then proposed
to make her his wife. Keeaumoku readily consented, but Kaahumanu could
only be won by the promise that her children should become the
political heirs of Kamehameha. This promise was given, and Kaahumanu
became the wife of Kamehameha. It is probable that he intended to
observe the compact at that time, but as Kaahumanu died childless he
was in the end left to dispose of the succession through other and more
distinguished channels.</p>
<p>Kaahumanu became the wife of Kamehameha&rsquo;s heart. He loved her
as well as he was capable of loving any woman, and she was the only one
whose indiscretions were regarded by him with feelings of jealousy. His
other wives were not restricted by him to his sole attentions, and even
the blue-blooded Keopuolani, whom he subsequently married, and who
became the mother of his heirs to the throne, had a joint husband in
Hoapili.</p>
<p>But in the affections of Kaahumanu Kamehameha would brook no joint
occupant or rival. She doubtless sought to avail herself of the
privileges of the times, but Kamehameha objected <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name="pb400">400</a>]</span>with
a frown which would have meant death to another, and for years their
relations were the reverse of harmonious.</p>

<p class="first">(HUGE FACE DELINEATED IN THE CLIFF.)</p>
</div>
<p>Kaiana&rsquo;s father was Ahaula, who was the son of Keawe, king of
Hawaii, by a mother whose name is now unknown. The mother of Kaiana was
Kaupekamoku, a granddaughter of Ahia, of the <a id="xd26e11122" name=
"xd26e11122"></a>family of Hilo, from whom the present sovereign of the
islands draws his strain. The birthplace of Kaiana is not recorded, but
he was probably reared in the neighborhood of Hilo, and thoroughly
instructed in all the chiefly accomplishments of the period. He grew to
a splendid manhood. He was nearly six and a half feet in height, was
well proportioned, and possessed a strikingly handsome face. This is
the testimony of Captain Meares, with whom he made a voyage to China in
1787.</p>
<p>Kaiana was of high rank and boundless ambition, and in early manhood
cast his fortunes with Kahekili, the warlike <i>moi</i> of Maui, to
whom he was related. He was among the prominent chiefs who assisted
Kahekili in his conquest of Oahu in 1783, and took a distinguished part
in the decisive battle of Kaheiki. Kahahana, the unfortunate king of
Oahu, escaped to the hills, where he remained secreted for nearly two
years, when he was betrayed by the brother of his wife and slain by
order of Kahekili.</p>
<p>This cruel treatment of Kahahana, together with the rapacity of the
invaders, created a revulsion of feeling among the Oahu chiefs, and a
wide-spread conspiracy was organized by the father of Kahahana and
others against Kahekili and the Maui chiefs to whom had been assigned
lands in the several districts of the island. The plan was to rise in
concert and kill them all in one night, including Kahekili. But the
murderous project miscarried. By some means it became known to
Kahekili, and he despatched messengers to the threatened chiefs,
warning them of their danger. All but one of them were notified. The
messenger failed to reach Hueu, who was at Waialua, and he was killed.
But fearfully was his death avenged. Kahekili collected his forces for
a war for blood. Men, women and children were butchered without mercy,
and the native Oahu chiefs were almost extirpated. So great was the
slaughter that one of the Maui chiefs built a house at Lapakea, the
walls of which were laid up with the bones of the slain.</p>
<p>In this rebellion a number of Kahekili&rsquo;s own chiefs turned
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name=
"pb401">401</a>]</span>against him, among whom were Kaiana and
Kaneoneo, the latter being the first husband of Kamakahelei, queen of
Kauai. What incited the defection of Kaiana is not known, but he was
probably dissatisfied with the lands apportioned to him by Kahekili,
and hoped to profit by the restoration of the island to native
rule.</p>
<p>Kaneoneo was killed, but Kaiana managed to escape to Kauai. Kaneoneo
was of the royal line of Kauai, and, as already stated, the first
husband of the queen of that island. How he came to be a supporter of
Kahekili in his conquest of Oahu, or what prompted his subsequent
espousal of the cause of the Oahu chiefs, are matters which tradition
has left to conjecture.</p>
<p>Kamakahelei&rsquo;s second husband, whom she had selected some years
before while her first was living, as was then the custom, was the
gallant Kaeo, or Kaeokulani, the younger brother of Kahekili. He was
commended to her not more through his princely blood than his many
accomplishments and graces of person, and she appears to have been
greatly attached to him.</p>
<p>She had two daughters with Kaneoneo, both of whom were of
marriageable age when she became the wife of Kaeo. She was the
granddaughter, it may be mentioned, of Lonoikahaupu, a prince of Kauai,
who in his younger years visited Hawaii, was accepted as the temporary
husband of Kalani, the sister of Keawe, and through her became the
grandfather of Keeaumoku and his two distinguished brothers. The
daughters of the queen were Lelemahoalani and Kapuaamohu, the latter of
whom, in marriage with Kaumualii, the last independent king of Kauai,
became the grandmother of the present queen, Kapiolani.</p>
<p>Kaeo took no part in the conquest of Oahu by his brother, but
remained at Kauai, assisting the queen in her government, while
Kaneoneo found occupation first in aiding and then in opposing
Kahekili. Escaping from Oahu after the defeat of the rebellious chiefs
and death of Kaneoneo, Kaiana presented himself before the queen of
Kauai, who was a distant relative, and Kaeo, who was of closer kinship,
and related to them the story of Kahekili&rsquo;s merciless operations
on Oahu. He sought to create an active sympathy in favor of the
unfortunate Oahuans, but Kaeo was too sagacious to place himself in
hostility to his warlike brother, who had extended his sway over all
the islands between Kauai and Hawaii. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb402" href="#pb402" name="pb402">402</a>]</span></p>
<p>However, Kaiana was kindly received at the court of Kauai, and given
lands for his proper maintenance. But he could not remain quiet. While
the clash of arms was heard on the other islands, he chafed under the
restraints of his exile, and attempted to organize a force of warriors
for a descent upon Oahu. Kaeo prevented the departure of the
expedition, however, and a mutual feeling of suspicion and antagonism
was soon developed between him and his reckless and restless
cousin.</p>
<p>As the avenues to advancement through the chances of war seemed to
be temporarily closed to him, Kaiana donned his best attire, gave
entertainments and began vigorously to play the courtier. He first
sought to supplant Kaeo in the affections of the queen. Failing in
that, he next paid court to her daughter Kapuaamohu. The latter was
disposed to regard his suit with favor, but Kaeo, through the pretended
advice of a <i>kaula</i>, objected to the alliance, and in a spirit of
recklessness Kaiana embarked in the ship <i>Nootka</i> for China late
in 1787. That vessel, in the course of trade, touched at Kauai just as
the fortunes of Kaiana seemed to be the most desperate, and Captain
Meares was easily prevailed upon to permit the handsome Hawaiian to
accompany him to the Asiatic coast.</p>
<p>Arriving in Canton, Kaiana spent some months in studying the arts of
war and mingling with the people of strange races, and in the latter
part of 1788 returned in the <i>Iphigenia</i> to Kauai, bringing with
him a very considerable supply of muskets, powder, lead and other
munitions of war. As the manner in which he secured these supplies is
not stated, we are constrained to believe that he must have taken with
him to China a quantity of sandal-wood, which was readily marketable in
that country.</p>
<p>But Kaeo would not permit him to land on Kauai. The clouds had
indicated approaching danger the day before, and Kaiana was told that
he would be slain and sacrificed if his foot touched the shore. The
vessel, therefore, sailed for Hawaii, where Kaiana landed and offered
his services to Kamehameha. They were promptly accepted. His supply of
arms and knowledge of other lands rendered him a valuable ally at the
time, and Kamehameha gave him an important command and took him into
his fullest confidence. This was early in 1789, and, in the succeeding
wars with Keoua, Kaiana became an active leader, as already mentioned.
The knives, hatchets, axes and swords <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb403" href="#pb403" name="pb403">403</a>]</span>brought by him from
China were found to be useful, but the fire-arms were generally of old
patterns, and the most of them were soon rendered entirely
unserviceable through the inability of the natives to keep them in
repair.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Very soon after her marriage Kaahumanu was detected in
flagrant flirtations with certain chiefs whose business brought them to
the court of her husband, and Kamehameha set a close watch upon her
actions. This led to bitter words between them, and in time it became a
matter of gossip that Kamehameha was jealous of his young wife. The
arrival of Kaiana added another to the list of Kaahumanu&rsquo;s
admirers, and in time another wrinkle to the stern face of her
warrior-husband. Kaiana was one of the handsomest chiefs of his day,
and Kaahumanu could not disguise her infatuation for him. But, whatever
may have been the temptation, he was too discreet to awaken the
jealousy of Kamehameha, and was not displeased when he was despatched
with an army against Keoua in the distant district of Kau.</p>
<p>After the death of Kalaniopuu, in 1782, and the defeat and death of
Kiwalao, the widow of the former, whose name was Kalola, left for Maui,
taking with her the widow and infant daughter of Kiwalao. Kahekili,
brother of Kalola, provided for the family and gave them his
protection. After the conquest of Oahu by Kahekili he removed his court
to that island, taking with him his sister and her family. In 1785 they
returned to Maui with Kalanikupule, the son of Kahekili, who had been
appointed viceroy of the island, and there remained, principally at
Olowalu, until 1790, when Kalanikupule was driven from Maui by
Kamehameha, and they sought refuge at Kalamaula, on the island of
Molokai.</p>
<p>Seeing his way clear to the conquest of the group, and anxious to
ally himself to the superior blood which came through Kalola and
Kiwalao, Kamehameha despatched a messenger to Molokai, requesting
Kalola not to return to Oahu, but to place herself and family under his
protection. Following the messenger to Molokai, and learning that
Kalola was ill and not expected to recover, Kamehameha paid her a visit
in person, and received the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href=
"#pb404" name="pb404">404</a>]</span>assurance of the dying dowager
that, when she passed away, her daughter and granddaughter should be
his.</p>
<p>The granddaughter was Keopuolani, then a girl of fourteen. She
subsequently became the wife of Kamehameha and the mother of the ruling
princes of his dynasty. In recognition of her superior rank Kamehameha
always approached her on his knees, even after she had become his wife
and he the undisputed sovereign of the group. Such was the deference
invariably paid to rank at that time and earlier.</p>
<p>Kalola did not live but a few days after her meeting with
Kamehameha. At her death he manifested his sorrow by knocking out two
of his front teeth, and then formally took charge of and removed to
Hawaii her daughter and granddaughter, not only as a sacred legacy from
Kalola, but as a token of reconciliation and alliance between himself
and the elder branch of the Keawe dynasty.</p>
<p>Kaahumanu well understood the meaning of this reconciliation, and it
was with little pleasure that she welcomed Liliha and her daughter to
Hawaii. She knew it was the purpose of Kamehameha to marry Keopuolani
as soon as she reached a proper age; but she was childless and could
urge no valid objection to the union. The thought of it, however, did
not sweeten her temper or quicken her sense of propriety. She became
more reckless, and her husband more and more suspicious, until they
finally separated, when Kaahumanu returned to her father, where she
remained for more than a year, and where, it is said, Kaiana frequently
visited her.</p>
<p>Of these visits Kamehameha was apprised by Kepupuohi, the wife of
Kaiana, of whom tradition makes but spare mention. She was jealous of
her husband&rsquo;s attentions to Kaahumanu, and it was through her
that Kamehameha became aware of their secret meetings. His spies had
overlooked what the jealous eyes of the wife had discovered, and it is
intimated that they retaliated in kind upon the recreant couple. Be
that as it may, Kamehameha sent for Kaahumanu, and through the offices
of Captain Vancouver, whose vessel was at that time anchored in
Kealakeakua Bay, a reconciliation was effected between them.</p>
<p>But Kamehameha did not forgive Kaiana. His thoughts were bent upon
the conquest of Oahu, and he needed his assistance in that important
enterprise; but he <span class="corr" id="xd26e11185" title=
"Source: determind">determined</span> to crush him whenever
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405" name=
"pb405">405</a>]</span>he could do so without injury to himself. Kaiana
felt the coldness of his chief, and had observed unmistakable evidences
of his hatred; but he neglected no duty, and resolved that, if an open
rupture could not be avoided, Kamehameha should not be in a position to
urge a reason for it that would command the respect and approval of his
supporting chiefs.</p>
<p>Summoning his district chiefs to muster their quotas of canoes and
armed men, Kamehameha prepared for the conquest of Oahu and a final
struggle for the mastery of the group. It is said that his army
numbered sixteen thousand warriors, some of them armed with muskets,
and that so great was the number of his canoes that they almost
blackened the channels through which they passed.</p>
<p>The army embarked from Hawaii early in 1795, and, after touching at
Lahaina for refreshments, landed for final preparation on Molokai, the
fleet of canoes being distributed for miles along the coast. Kaiana had
promptly responded to the call of his chief, and was there with a heavy
quota of warriors and canoes.</p>
<p>A council of war was called at Kaunakakai to discuss the plans of
the campaign, but Kaiana was not invited to participate in its
proceedings. His exclusion from the council alarmed Kaiana, and he
suspected that he was the principal subject of discussion. He left his
quarters, and calling at the house of Namahana, the mother of
Kaahumanu, learned from her that the council was discussing some
private matter, the nature of which she did not know. He next visited
Kalaimoku, after the adjournment of the council, and endeavored to
ascertain what had been done, but the answers of the chief were evasive
and unsatisfactory. He did not dare to tell Kaiana, who was allied to
him in blood, that Kamehameha had charged Kaiana before the council
with meditated treason, which implied his death, and that his advisers
had prevailed upon him to allow the matter to rest until after the
conquest of Oahu.</p>
<p>On his way back to Hamiloloa, where his warriors were encamped,
Kaiana again passed the house of Namahana. It was past sunset, and he
was striding through the dying twilight, his thoughts a tumult of doubt
and indignation, when from behind a clump of bushes he heard his name
pronounced in a low tone. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href=
"#pb406" name="pb406">406</a>]</span>He stopped and listened, and
&ldquo;Kaiana!&rdquo; again came to him in a soft voice.</p>
<p>Fearful of treachery, he hesitated for a moment, then drew a knife
from a scabbard hanging from his neck, and cautiously walked around the
screening undergrowth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who calls?&rdquo; inquired Kaiana, observing a crouching
figure among the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friend,&rdquo; was the answer; and Kaahumanu rose and
stood before him.</p>
<p>What passed between them can only be conjectured; but Kaahumanu must
have satisfied Kaiana of Kamehameha&rsquo;s hostile purposes concerning
him, for when he reached his quarters he promptly informed his brother
Nahiolea of the danger awaiting both of them, and apprised him of his
resolution to abandon Kamehameha on the passage to Oahu and join forces
with Kalanikupule. &ldquo;The movement is hazardous,&rdquo; explained
Kaiana, &ldquo;but it will enable us, at least, to die like chiefs,
with arms in our hands, instead of being slain like dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the several divisions were preparing to embark for Oahu the next
morning, Kaiana visited the squadron of canoes set apart for the
accommodation of the wives and daughters of Kamehameha and his
principal chiefs, and secretly informed his wife of his purpose to join
Kalanikupule. She expressed surprise at the announcement, but declined
to follow him, declaring that she preferred to cast her fortunes with
Kamehameha. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she continued, bitterly, &ldquo;perhaps
Kaahumanu would follow you, if asked to do so!&rdquo; Kaiana made no
reply to this cutting suggestion, but waved his wife a hasty farewell,
and joined his embarking warriors.</p>
<p>The other divisions of the invading army were well out to sea before
Kaiana&rsquo;s sails were set, and he found no difficulty in making his
way unobserved to Kailua, on the northern side of the island, while
Kamehameha landed with the main body of his forces in the neighborhood
of Honolulu, his canoes extending along the beach from Waialae to
Waikiki.</p>
<p>Disembarking his warriors at Kailua, to the number of perhaps
fifteen hundred, Kaiana offered his services to Kalanikupule, whose
army was rapidly occupying positions in the valleys back of Honolulu.
The <i>moi</i> received him with open arms, promising him the
sovereignty of Maui should they succeed in destroying <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name=
"pb407">407</a>]</span>Kamehameha; and the united armies, climbing over
the Nuuanu and Kalihi passes, confronted the advancing lines of
Kamehameha.</p>
<p>Learning of the desertion of Kaiana and the warriors under his
command, Kamehameha exhibited but little surprise. He did not doubt his
ability to defeat the combined armies of his opponents, for the
auguries had been favorable and he had faith in his gods; nor did he
regret that through his defection Kaiana had at last placed himself in
a position to be dealt with as an open enemy.</p>
<p>With his war-god <i>Kaili</i> in the van, Kamehameha, at the head of
a mighty force, marched up Nuuanu Valley, where, three miles back of
Honolulu, behind a stone wall stretching from one hill to the other of
the narrowing gorge, was entrenched the main body of the allied armies.
And behind the wall stood Kaiana, grim, silent and desperate, with a
musket in his hand, awaiting the approach of Kamehameha.</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer advanced the attacking column, with shouts that
were repaid by yells of defiance from behind the defences. A few
volleys of musketry were exchanged by the hundred or more of warriors
in possession of fire-arms on each side, but Kaiana took no part in the
noisy conflict. He was watching for the approach of one whose life he
longed for more than all the rest, and for which he was willing to
exchange his own.</p>
<p>But he watched in vain. A field-piece, under the direction of John
Young, was brought to bear upon the wall, and Kaiana fell with the
first shot, mortally wounded. After a few more shots the Hawaiians
charged up the hill, their shouts drowning the roar of the breakers
against the reef below. Kaiana drew himself up against the wall. His
heart had been laid almost bare, and his eyes were growing dim. With an
effort he raised his musket, fired it at random in the direction of the
storming column, hoping the bullet might by chance find the heart of
Kamehameha, and then fell dead.</p>
<p>The rout of the Oahuans and their allies was complete. They broke
and fled in all directions. Some were driven over the <i>pali</i>, a
precipice six or seven hundred feet in height at the head of the
valley, and others escaped over the hills. Kalanikupule found refuge
for a time in the mountains, but he was finally captured, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name=
"pb408">408</a>]</span>slain and offered as a sacrifice to
Kamehameha&rsquo;s war-god at Waikiki.</p>
<p>This was the last battle of the conquest, and the victory gave to
Kamehameha the sovereignty of the group, for the king of Kauai,
recognizing his power, soon after yielded to him his peaceful
allegiance. But it brought to a close the career of one of the most
noted of modern Hawaiian chiefs&mdash;Kaiana-a-Ahaula&mdash;over whose
death Kamehameha rejoiced, and Kaahumanu mourned in silence. Her love
proved fatal to more than one, but he was the grandest and brightest of
all who perished by the sweet poison of her smiles. <span class=

<p class="first">Beneath one of the boldest of the rocky bluffs against
which dash the breakers of Kaumalapau Bay, on the little island of
Lanai, is the <i>Puhio-Kaala</i>, or &ldquo;Spouting Cave of
Kaala.&rdquo; The only entrance to it is through the vortex of a
whirlpool, which marks the place where, at intervals, the receding
waters rise in a column of foam above the surface. Within, the floor of
the cave gradually rises from the opening beneath the waters until a
landing is reached above the level of the tides, and to the right and
left, farther than the eye can penetrate by the dim light struggling
through the surging waves, stretch dank and shelly shores, where crabs,
polypii, sting-rays and other noisome creatures of the deep find
protection against their larger enemies.</p>
<p>This cavern was once a favorite resort of <i>Mooalii</i>, the great
lizard-god; but as the emissaries of <i>Ukanipo</i>, the shark-god,
annoyed him greatly and threatened to imprison him within it by piling
a mountain of rocks against the opening, he abandoned it and found a
home in a cave near Kaulapapa, in the neighboring island of Molokai,
where many rude temples were erected to him by the fishermen.</p>
<p>Before the days of Kamehameha I. resolute divers frequently visited
the Spouting Cave, and on one occasion fire, enclosed in a small
calabash, was taken down through the whirlpool, with the view of making
a light and exploring its mysterious chambers; but the fire was
scattered and extinguished by an unseen hand, and those who brought it
hastily retreated to escape a shower of rocks sent down upon them from
the roof of the cavern. The existence of the cave is still known, and
the whirlpool and spouting column marking the entrance to it are
pointed out; but longer and longer have grown the intervals between the
visits of divers to its sunless depths, until the present generation
can <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href="#pb412" name=
"pb412">412</a>]</span>point to not more than one, perhaps, who has
ventured to enter them.</p>
<p>Tradition has brought down the outlines of a number of supernatural
and romantic stories connected with the Spouting Cave, but the nearest
complete and most recent of these <i>mookaaos</i> is the legend of
Kaala, the flower of Lanai, which is here given at considerably less
length than native narration accords it.</p>
<p>It was during an interval of comparative quiet, if not of peace, in
the stormy career of Kamehameha I., near the close of the last century,
and after the battle of Maunalei, that he went with his court to the
island of Lanai for a brief season of recreation. The visit was not
made for the purpose of worshipping at the great <i>heiau</i> of
<i>Kaunola</i>, which was then half in ruins, or at any of the lesser
temples scattered here and there over the little island, and dedicated,
in most instances, to fish-gods. He went to Kealia simply to enjoy a
few days of rest away from the scenes of his many conflicts, and feast
for a time upon the affluent fishing-grounds of that locality.</p>
<p>He made the journey with six double canoes, all striped with yellow,
and his own bearing the royal ensign. He took with him his war-god,
<i>Kaili</i>, and a small army of attendants, consisting of priests,
<i>kahunas</i>, <i>kahili</i> and spittoon-bearers, stewards, cooks and
other household servants, as well as a retinue of distinguished chiefs
with their personal retainers in their own canoes, and a hundred
warriors in the capacity of a royal guard.</p>
<p>Landing, the victorious chief was received with enthusiasm by the
five or six thousand people then inhabiting the island. He took up his
residence in the largest of the several cottages provided for him and
his personal attendants. Provisions were brought in abundance, and
flowers and sweet-scented herbs and vines were contributed without
stint. The chief and his titled attendants were garlanded with them.
They were strewn in his path, cast at his door and thrown upon his
dwelling, until their fragrance seemed to fill all the air.</p>
<p>Among the many who brought offerings of flowers was the beautiful
Kaala, &ldquo;the sweet-scented flower of Lanai,&rdquo; as she was
called. She was a girl of fifteen, and in grace and beauty had no peer
on the island. She was the daughter of Oponui, a chief of one of the
lower grades, and her admirers were counted by the hundreds. Of the
many who sought her as a wife was Mailou, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb413" href="#pb413" name="pb413">413</a>]</span>&ldquo;the
bone-breaker.&rdquo; He was a huge, muscular savage, capable of
crushing almost any ordinary man in an angry embrace; and while Kaala
hated, feared and took every occasion to avoid him, her father favored
his suit, doubtless pleased at the thought of securing in a son-in-law
a friend and champion so distinguished for his strength and
ferocity.</p>
<p>As Kaala scattered flowers before the chief her graceful movements
and modesty were noted by Kaaialii, and when he saw her face he was
enraptured with its beauty. Although young in years, he was one of
Kamehameha&rsquo;s most valued lieutenants, and had distinguished
himself in many battles. He was of chiefly blood and bearing, with
sinewy limbs and a handsome face, and when he stopped to look into the
eyes of Kaala and tell her that she was beautiful, she thought the
words, although they had been frequently spoken to her by others, had
never sounded so sweetly to her before. He asked her for a simple
flower, and she twined a <i>lei</i> for his neck. He asked her for a
smile, and she looked up into his face and gave him her heart.</p>
<p>They saw each other the next day, and the next, and then Kaaialii
went to his chief and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love the beautiful Kaala, daughter of Oponui. Your will is
law. Give her to me for a wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Kamehameha smiled without speaking, and then
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl is not mine to give. We must be just. I will send
for her father. Come to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kaaialii had hoped for a different answer; but neither protest nor
further explanation was admissible, and all he could do was to thank
the king and retire.</p>
<p>A messenger brought Oponui to the presence of Kamehameha. He was
received kindly, and told that Kaaialii loved Kaala and desired to make
her his wife. The information kindled the wrath of Oponui. He hated
Kaaialii, but did not dare to exhibit his animosity before the king. He
was in the battle of Maunalei, where he narrowly escaped death at the
hands of Kaaialii, after his spear had found the heart of one of his
dearest friends, and he felt that he would rather give his daughter to
the sharks than to one who had sought his life and slain his friend.
But he pretended to regard the proposal with favor, and, in answer to
the king, expressed regret that he had promised his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414" name=
"pb414">414</a>]</span>daughter to Mailou, the bone-breaker.
&ldquo;However,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;in respect to the interest
which it has pleased you, great chief, to take in the matter, I am
content that the girl shall fall to the victor in a contest with bare
hands between Mailou and Kaaialii.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposal seemed to be fair, and, not doubting that Kaaialii
would promptly accept it, the king gave it his approval, and the
contest was fixed for the day following. Oponui received the
announcement with satisfaction, not doubting that Mailou would crush
Kaaialii in his rugged embrace as easily as he had broken the bones of
many an adversary.</p>
<p>News of the coming contest spread rapidly, and the next day
thousands of persons assembled at Kealia to witness it. Kaala was in an
agony of fear. The thought of becoming the wife of the bone-breaker
almost distracted her, for it was said that he had had many wives, all
of whom had disappeared one after another as he tired of them, and the
whisper was that he had crushed and thrown them into the sea. And,
besides, she loved Kaaialii, and deemed it scarcely possible that he
should be able to meet and successfully combat the prodigious strength
and ferocity of one who had never been subdued.</p>
<p>As Kaaialii was approaching the spot where the contest was to take
place, in the presence of Kamehameha and his court and a large
concourse of less distinguished spectators, Kaala sprang from the side
of her father, and, seizing the young chief by the hand, exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have indeed slain my people in war, but rescue me from
the horrible embrace of the bone-breaker, and I will catch the squid
and beat the <i>kapa</i> for you all my days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a dark frown upon his face, Oponui tore the girl from her lover
before he could reply. Kaaialii followed her with his eyes until she
disappeared among the spectators, and then pressed forward through the
crowd and stepped within the circle reserved for the combatants. Mailou
was already there. He was indeed a muscular brute, with long arms,
broad shoulders and mighty limbs tattooed with figures of sharks and
birds of prey. He was naked to the loins, and, as Kaaialii approached,
his fingers opened and closed, as if impatient to clutch and tear his
adversary in pieces.</p>
<p>Although less bulky than the bone-breaker, Kaaialii was large
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name=
"pb415">415</a>]</span>and perfectly proportioned, with well-knit
muscles and loins and shoulders suggestive of unusual strength. Nude,
with the exception of a <i>maro</i>, he was a splendid specimen of
vigorous manhood; but, in comparison with those of the bone-breaker,
his limbs appeared to be frail and feminine, and a general expression
of sympathy for the young chief was observed in the faces of the large
assemblage as they turned from him to the sturdy giant he was about to
encounter.</p>
<p>The contest was to be one of strength, courage, agility and skill
combined. Blows with the clenched fist, grappling, strangling, tearing,
breaking and every other injury which it was possible to inflict were
permitted. In <i>hakoko</i> (wrestling) and <i>moko</i> (boxing)
contests certain rules were usually observed, in order that fatal
injuries might be avoided; but in the combat between Kaaialii and
Mailou no rule or custom was to govern. It was to be a savage struggle
to the death.</p>
<p>Taunt and boasting are the usual prelude to personal conflicts among
the uncivilized; nor was it deemed unworthy the Saxon knight to meet
his adversary with insult and bravado. The object was not more to
unnerve his opponent than to steel his own courage. With the
bone-breaker, however, there was little fear or doubt concerning the
result. He knew the measure of his own prodigious strength, and, with a
malignant smile that laid bare his shark-like teeth, he glared with
satisfaction upon his rival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed the bone-breaker, taking a stride
toward Kaaialii; &ldquo;so <i>you</i> are the insane youth who has
dared to meet Mailou in combat! Do you know who I am? I am the
bone-breaker! In my hands the limbs of men are like tender cane. Come,
and with one hand let me strangle you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will need both!&rdquo; replied Kaaialii. &ldquo;I know
you. You are a breaker of the bones of women, not of men! You speak
brave words, but have the heart of a coward. Let the word be given, and
if you do not run from me to save your life, as I half-suspect you
will, I will put my foot upon your broken neck before you find time to
cry for mercy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Mailou could retort the word was given, and with an
exclamation of rage he sprang at the throat of Kaaialii. Feigning as if
to meet the shock, the latter waited until the hands of Mailou were
almost at his throat, when with a quick movement <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416" name="pb416">416</a>]</span>he
struck them up, swayed his body to the left, and with his right foot
adroitly tripped his over-confident assailant. The momentum of Mailou
was so great that he fell headlong to the earth. Springing upon him
before he could rise, Kaaialii seized his right arm, and with a
vigorous blow of the foot broke the bone below the elbow. Rising and
finding his right arm useless, Mailou attempted to grapple his
adversary with the left, but a well-delivered blow felled him again to
the earth, and Kaaialii broke his left arm as he had broken the right.
Regaining his feet, and unable to use either hand, with a wild howl of
despair the bone-breaker rushed upon Kaaialii, with the view of dealing
him a blow with his bent head; but the young chief again tripped him as
he passed, and, seizing him by the hair as he fell, placed his knees
against the back of his prostrate foe and broke his spine.</p>
<p>This, of course, ended the struggle, and Kaaialii was declared the
victor, amidst the plaudits of the spectators and the congratulations
of Kamehameha and the court. Breaking from her father, who was
grievously disappointed at the unlooked-for result, and who sought to
detain her, Kaala sprang through the crowd and threw herself into the
arms of Kaaialii. Oponui would have protested, and asked that his
daughter might be permitted to visit her mother before becoming the
wife of Kaaialii; but the king put an end to his hopes by placing the
hand of Kaala in that of the victorious chief, and saying to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have won her nobly. She is now your wife. Take her with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although silenced by the voice of the king, and compelled to submit
to the conditions of a contest which he had himself proposed,
Oponui&rsquo;s hatred of Kaaialii knew no abatement, and all that day
and the night following he sat alone by the sea-shore, devising a means
by which Kaala and her husband might be separated. He finally settled
upon a plan.</p>
<p>The morning after her marriage Oponui visited Kaala, as if he had
just returned from Mahana, where her mother was supposed to be then
living. He greeted her with apparent affection, and was profuse in his
expressions of friendship for Kaaialii. He embraced them both, and
said: &ldquo;I now see that you love each other; my prayer is that you
may live long and happily together.&rdquo; He then told Kaala that
Kalani, her mother, was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href=
"#pb417" name="pb417">417</a>]</span>lying dangerously ill at Mahana,
and, believing that she would not recover, desired to see and bless her
daughter before she died. Kaala believed the story, for her father wept
when he told it, and moaned as if for the dead, and beat his breast;
and, with many protestations of love, Kaaialii allowed her to depart
with Oponui, with the promise from both of them that she would speedily
return to the arms of her husband.</p>
<p>With some misgivings, Kaaialii watched her from the top of the hill
above Kealia until she descended into the valley of Palawai. There
leaving the path that led to Mahana, they journeyed toward the bay of
Kaumalapau. Satisfied that her father was for some purpose deceiving
her, Kaala protested and was about to return, when he acknowledged that
her mother was not ill at Mahana, as he had represented to Kaaialii in
order to secure his consent to her departure, but at the sea-shore,
where she had gathered crabs, shrimps, limpets and other delicacies,
and prepared a feast in celebration of her marriage.</p>
<p>Reassured by the plausible story, and half-disposed to pardon the
deception admitted by her father, Kaala proceeded with him to the
sea-shore. She saw that her mother was not there, and heard no sound
but the beating of the waves against the rocks. She looked up into the
face of her father for an explanation; but his eyes were cold, and a
cruel smile upon his lips told her better than words that she had been
betrayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is my mother?&rdquo; she inquired; and then bitterly
added: &ldquo;I do not see her fire by the shore. Must we search for
her among the sharks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oponui no longer sought to disguise his real purpose. &ldquo;Hear
the truth!&rdquo; he said, with a wild glare in his eyes that whitened
the lips of Kaala. &ldquo;The shark shall be your mate, but he will not
harm you. You shall go to his home, but he will not devour you. Down
among the gods of the sea I will leave you until Kaaialii, hated by me
above all things that breathe, shall have left Lanai, and then I will
bring you back to earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terrified at these words, Kaala screamed and sought to fly; but her
heartless father seized her by the hand and dragged her along the shore
until they reached a bench of the rocky bluff overlooking the opening
to the Spouting Cave. Oponui was among the few who had entered the
cavern through its gate of circling waters, and he did not for a moment
doubt that within <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href="#pb418"
name="pb418">418</a>]</span>its gloomy walls, where he was about to
place her, Kaala would remain securely hidden until such time as he
might choose to restore her to the light.</p>
<p>Standing upon the narrow ledge above the entrance to the cave,
marked by alternate whirlpool and receding column, Kaala divined the
barbarous purpose of her father, and implored him to give her body to
the sharks at once rather than leave her living in the damp and
darkness of the Spouting Cave, to be tortured by the slimy and venomous
creatures of the sea.</p>
<p>Deaf to her entreaties, Oponui watched until the settling column
went down into the throat of the whirlpool, when he gathered the
frantic and struggling girl in his arms and sprang into the circling
abyss. Sinking a fathom or more below the surface, and impelled by a
strong current setting toward the mouth of the cave, he soon found and
was swept through the entrance, and in a few moments stood upon a rocky
beach in the dim twilight of the cavern, with the half-unconscious
Kaala clinging to his neck.</p>
<p>The only light penetrating the cave was the little refracted through
the waters, and every object that was not too dark to be seen looked
greenish and ghostly. Crabs, eels, sting-rays and other noisome
creatures of the deep were crawling stealthily among the rocks, and the
dull thunder of the battling waves was the only sound that could be
distinguished.</p>
<p>Disengaging her arms, he placed her upon the beach above the reach
of the waters, and then sat down beside her to recover his breath and
wait for a retreating current to bear him to the surface. Reviving,
Kaala looked around her with horror, and piteously implored her father
not to leave her in that dreadful place beneath the waters.</p>
<p>For some time he made no reply, and then it was to tell her harshly
that she might return with him if she would promise to accept the love
of the chief of Olowalu, in the valley of Palawai, and allow Kaaialii
to see her in the embrace of another. This she refused to do, declaring
that she would perish in the cave, or the attempt to leave it, rather
than be liberated on such monstrous conditions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then here you will remain,&rdquo; said Oponui, savagely,
&ldquo;until I return, or the chief of Olowalu comes to bear you off to
his home in Maui!&rdquo; Then, rising to his feet, he continued
hastily, as he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=
"pb419">419</a>]</span>noted a turn in the current at the opening:
&ldquo;You cannot escape without assistance. If you attempt it you will
be dashed against the rocks and become the food of sharks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this warning Oponui turned and plunged into the water. Diving
and passing with the current through the entrance, he was borne swiftly
to the surface and to his full length up into the spouting column; but
he coolly precipitated himself into the surrounding waters, and with a
few strokes of the arms reached the shore.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Kaaialii watched the departure of Kaala and her father
until they disappeared in the valley of Palawai, and then gloomily
returned to his hut. His fears troubled him. He thought of his
beautiful Kaala, and his heart ached for her warm embrace. Then he
thought of the looks and words of Oponui, and recalled in both a
suggestion of deceit. Thus harassed with his thoughts, he spent the day
in roaming alone among the hills, and the following night in restless
slumber, with dreams of death and torture. The portentous cry of an
<i>alae</i> roused him from his <i>kapa-moe</i> before daylight, and
until the sun rose he sat watching the stars. Then he climbed the hill
overlooking the valley of Palawai to watch for the return of Kaala, and
wonder what could have detained her so long. He watched until the sun
was well up in the heavens, feeling neither thirst nor hunger, and at
length saw a <i>pau</i> fluttering in the wind far down the valley.</p>
<p>A woman was rapidly approaching, and his heart beat with joy, for he
thought she was Kaala. Nearer and nearer she came, and Kaaialii, still
hopeful, ran down to the path to meet her. Her step was light and her
air graceful, and it was not until he had opened his arms to receive
her that he saw that the girl was not Kaala. She was Ua, the friend of
Kaala, and almost her equal in beauty. They had been reared together,
and in their love for each other were like sisters. They loved the same
flowers, the same wild songs of the birds, the same paths among the
hills, and, now that Kaala loved Kaaialii, Ua loved him also.</p>
<p>Recognizing Kaaialii as she approached, Ua stopped before him, and
bent her eyes to the ground without speaking. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href="#pb420" name="pb420">420</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Kaala?&rdquo; inquired Kaaialii, raising the face of
Ua and staring eagerly into it. &ldquo;Have you seen her? Has any ill
come to her? Speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not seen her, and know of no ill that has befallen
her,&rdquo; replied the girl; &ldquo;but I have come to tell you that
Kaala has not yet reached the hut of Kalani, her mother; and as Oponui,
with a dark look in his face, was seen to lead her through the forest
of Kumoku, it is feared that she has been betrayed and will not be
allowed to return to Kealia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that, too, has been my fear since the moment I lost sight
of her in the valley of Palawai,&rdquo; said Kaaialii. &ldquo;I should
not have trusted her father, for I knew him to be treacherous and
unforgiving. May the wrath of the gods follow him if harm has come to
her through his cruelty! But I will find her if she is on the island!
The gods have given her to me, and in life or death she shall be
mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terrified at the wild looks and words of Kaaialii, Ua clasped her
hands in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; he continued, bending his ear toward the valley.
&ldquo;It seems that I hear her calling for me now!&rdquo; And with an
exclamation of rage and despair Kaaialii started at a swift pace down
the path taken by Kaala the day before. As he hurried onward, he saw,
at intervals, the footprints of Kaala in the dust, and every imprint
seemed to increase his speed.</p>
<p>Reaching the point where the Mahana path diverged from the somewhat
broader <i>ala</i> of the valley, he followed it for some distance
hoping that Ua had been misinformed, and that Kaala had really visited
her mother and might be found with her; but when he looked for and
failed to find the marks of her feet where in reason they should have
been seen had she gone to Mahana with her father, he returned and
continued his course down the valley.</p>
<p>Suddenly he stopped. The footprints for which he was watching had
now disappeared from the Palawai path, and for a moment he stood
looking irresolutely around, as if in doubt concerning the direction
next to be pursued. In his uncertainty several plans of action
presented themselves. One was, to see what information could be
gathered from Kaala&rsquo;s mother at Mahana, another to follow the
Palawai valley to the sea, and a third to return to Kealia and consult
a <i>kaula</i>. While these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href=
"#pb421" name="pb421">421</a>]</span>various suggestions were being
rapidly canvassed, and before any conclusion could be reached, the
figure of a man was seen approaching from the valley below.</p>
<p>Kaaialii secreted himself behind a rock, where he could watch the
path without being seen. The man drew nearer and nearer, until at last
Kaaialii was enabled to distinguish the features of Oponui, of all men
the one whom he most desired to meet. His muscles grew rigid with
wrath, and his hot breath burned the rock behind which he was
crouching. He buried his fingers in the earth to teach them patience,
and clenched his teeth to keep down a struggling exclamation of
vengeance. And so he waited until Oponui reached a curve in the path
which brought him, in passing, within a few paces of the eyes that were
savagely glaring upon him, and the next moment the two men stood facing
each other.</p>
<p>Startled at the unexpected appearance of Kaaialii, Oponui betrayed
his guilt at once by attempting to fly; but, with the cry of
&ldquo;Give me Kaala!&rdquo; Kaaialii sprang forward and endeavored to
seize him by the throat.</p>
<p>A momentary struggle followed; but Oponui was scarcely less powerful
than his adversary, and, his shoulders being bare, he succeeded in
breaking from the grasp of Kaaialii and seeking safety in flight toward
Kealia.</p>
<p>With a cry of disappointment, Kaaialii started in pursuit. Both were
swift of foot, and the race was like that of a hungry shark following
his prey. One was inspired by fear and the other with rage, and every
muscle of the runners was strained. Leaving the valley path, Oponui
struck for Kealia by a shorter course across the hills. He hoped the
roughness of the route and his better knowledge of it would give him an
advantage; but Kaaialii kept closely at his heels. On they sped, up and
down hills, across ravines and along rocky ridges, until they reached
Kealia, when Oponui suddenly turned to the left and made a dash for the
temple and <i>puhonua</i> not far distant. Kaaialii divined his
purpose, and with a last supreme effort sought to thwart it. Gaining
ground with every step, he made a desperate grasp at the shoulder of
Oponui just as the latter sprang through the entrance and dropped to
the earth exhausted within the protecting walls of the <i>puhonua</i>.
Kaaialii attempted to follow, but two priests promptly stepped into the
portal and refused to allow him to pass. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb422" href="#pb422" name="pb422">422</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand out of the way, or I will strangle you both!&rdquo;
exclaimed Kaaialii, fiercely, as he threw himself against the
guards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you insane?&rdquo; said another long-haired priest,
stepping forward with a <i>tabu</i> staff in his hand. &ldquo;Do you
not know that this is a <i>puhonua</i>, sacred to all who seek its
protection? Would you bring down upon yourself the wrath of the gods by
shedding blood within its walls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I may not enter, then drive him forth!&rdquo; replied
Kaaialii, pointing toward Oponui, who was lying upon the ground a few
paces within, intently regarding the proceedings at the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That cannot be,&rdquo; returned the priest. &ldquo;Should he
will to leave, the way will not be closed to him; otherwise he may
remain in safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coward!&rdquo; cried Kaaialii, addressing Oponui in a
taunting tone. &ldquo;Is it thus that you seek protection from the
anger of an unarmed man? A <i>pau</i> would better become you than a
<i>maro</i>. You should twine <i>leis</i> and beat <i>kapa</i> with
women, and think no more of the business of men. Come without the
walls, if your trembling limbs will bear you, and I will serve you as I
did your friend, the breaker of women&rsquo;s bones. Come, and I will
tear from your throat the tongue that lied to Kaala, and feed it to the
dogs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A malignant smile wrinkled the face of Oponui, as he thought of
Kaala in her hiding-place under the sea, but he made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you fear me?&rdquo; continued Kaaialii. &ldquo;Then arm
yourself with spear and battle-axe, and with bare hands I will meet and
strangle you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oponui remained silent, and in a paroxysm of rage and disappointment
Kaaialii threw himself upon the ground and cursed the <i>tabu</i> that
barred him from his enemy.</p>
<p>His friends found and bore him to his hut, and Ua, with gentle arts
and loving hands, sought to soothe and comfort him. But he would not be
consoled. He talked and thought alone of Kaala, and, hastily partaking
of food that he might retain his strength, started again in search of
her. Pitying his distress, Ua followed him&mdash;not closely, but so
that she might not lose sight of him altogether.</p>
<p>He traveled in every direction, stopping neither for food nor rest.
Of every one he met he inquired for Kaala, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name=
"pb423">423</a>]</span>called her name in the deep valleys and on the
hill-tops. Wandering near the sacred spring at the head of the waters
of Kealia, he met a white-haired priest bearing from the fountain a
calabash of water for ceremonial use in one of the temples. The priest
knew and feared him, for his looks were wild, and humbly offered him
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask not for food or water, old man,&rdquo; said Kaaialii.
&ldquo;You are a priest&mdash;perhaps a <i>kaula</i>. Tell me where I
can find Kaala, the daughter of Oponui, and I will pile your altars
with sacrifices!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son of the long spear,&rdquo; replied the priest, &ldquo;I
know you seek the sweet-smelling flower of Palawai. Her father alone
knows of her hiding-place. But it is not here in the hills, nor is it
in the valleys. Oponui loves and frequents the sea. He hunts for the
squid in dark places, and dives for the great fish in deep waters. He
knows of cliffs that are hollow, and of caves with entrances below the
waves. He goes alone to the rocky shore, and sleeps with the fish-gods,
who are his friends. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more of him!&rdquo; interrupted the chief, impatiently.
&ldquo;Tell me what has become of Kaala!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be patient, and you shall hear,&rdquo; resumed the priest.
&ldquo;In one of the caverns of the sea, known to Oponui and others,
has Kaala been hidden. So I see her now. The place is dark and her
heart is full of terror. Hasten to her. Be vigilant, and you will find
her; but sleep not, or she will be the food of the creatures of the
sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanking the priest, Kaaialii started toward the bay of Kaumalapau,
followed by the faithful Ua, and did not rest until he stood upon the
bluff of Palikaholo, overlooking the sea. Wildly the waves beat against
the rocks. Looking around, he could discern no hiding-place along the
shore, and the thunder of the breakers and the screams of the sea-gulls
were the only sounds to be heard. In despair he raised his voice and
wildly exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kaala! O Kaala! where are you? Do you sleep with the
fish-gods, and must I seek you in their homes among the sunken
shores?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bluff where he was standing overlooked and was immediately above
the Spouting Cave, from the submerged entrance to which a column of
water was rising above the surface and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb424" href="#pb424" name="pb424">424</a>]</span>breaking into spray.
In the mist of the upheaval he thought he saw the shadowy face and form
of Kaala, and in the tumult of the rushing waters fancied that he heard
her voice calling him to come to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kaala, I come!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and with a wild leap
sprang from the cliff to clasp the misty form of his bride.</p>
<p>He sank below the surface, and, as the column disappeared with him
and he returned no more, Ua wailed upon the winds a requiem of love and
grief in words like these:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Oh! dead is Kaaialii, the young chief of
Hawaii,</p>
<p class="line">The chief of few years and many battles!</p>
<p class="line">His limbs were strong and his heart was gentle;</p>
<p class="line">His face was like the sun, and he was without fear.</p>
<p class="line">Dead is the slayer of the bone-breaker;</p>
<p class="line">Dead is the chief who crushed the bones of Mailou;</p>
<p class="line">Dead is the lover of Kaala and the loved of Ua.</p>
<p class="line">For his love he plunged into the deep waters;</p>
<p class="line">For his love he gave his life. Who is like
Kaaialii?</p>
<p class="line">Kaala is hidden away, and I am lonely;</p>
<p class="line">Kaaialii is dead, and the black <i>kapa</i> is over my
heart:</p>
<p class="line">Now let the gods take the life of Ua!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">With a last look at the spot where Kaaialii had
disappeared, Ua hastened to Kealia, and at the feet of Kamehameha told
of the rash act of the despairing husband of Kaala. The king was
greatly grieved at the story of Ua, for he loved the young chief almost
as if he had been his son. &ldquo;It is useless to search for the body
of Kaaialii,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for the sharks have eaten
it.&rdquo; Then, turning to one of his chiefs, he continued: &ldquo;No
pile can be raised over his bones. Send for Ualua, the poet, that a
chant may be made in praise of Kaaialii.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Approaching nearer, Papakua, a priest, requested permission to
speak. It was granted, and he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me hope that my words may be of comfort. I have heard the
story of Ua, and cannot believe that the young chief is dead. The
spouting waters into which Kaaialii leaped mark the entrance to the
cave of Palikaholo. Following downward the current, has he not been
drawn into the cavern, where he has found Kaala, and may still be
living? Such, at least, is my thought, great chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wild thought, indeed!&rdquo; replied the king; &ldquo;yet
there is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425" name=
"pb425">425</a>]</span>some comfort in it, and we will see how much of
truth it may reveal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Preparations were hastily made, and with four of his sturdiest
oarsmen Kamehameha started around the shore for the Spouting Cave under
the bluff of Palikaholo, preceded by Ua in a canoe with Keawe, her
brother.</p>

<h3 class="main">III.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Kaaialii plunged into the sea he had little
thought of anything but death. Grasping at the spouting column as he
descended, it seemed to sink with him to the surface, and even below
it, and in a moment he felt himself being propelled downward and toward
the cliff by a strong current. Recklessly yielding to the action of the
waters, he soon discerned an opening in the submerged base of the
bluff, and without an effort was drawn swiftly into it. The force of
the current subsided, and to his surprise his head rose above the
surface and he was able to breathe. His feet touched a rocky bottom,
and he rose and looked around with a feeling of bewilderment. His first
thought was that he was dead and had reached the dark shores of
<i>Po</i>, where <i>Milu</i>, prince of death, sits enthroned in a
grove of <i>kou</i> trees; but he smote his breast, and by the smart
knew that he was living, and had been borne by the waters into a cave
beneath the cliff from which he had leaped to grasp the misty form of
Kaala.</p>
<p>Emerging from the water, Kaaialii found himself standing on the
shore of a dimly-lighted cavern. The air was chilly, and slimy objects
touched his feet, and others fell splashing into the water from the
rocks. He wondered whether it would be possible for him to escape from
the gloomy place, and began to watch the movements of the waters near
the opening, when a low moan reached his ear.</p>
<p>It was the voice of Kaala. She was lying near him in the darkness on
the slimy shore. Her limbs were bruised and lacerated with her
fruitless attempts to leave the cave, and she no longer possessed the
strength to repel the crabs and other loathsome creatures that were
drinking her blood and feeding upon her quivering flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the wailing of the wind, or perhaps of some demon of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426" name=
"pb426">426</a>]</span>the sea who makes this horrible place his
home,&rdquo; thought Kaaialii.</p>
<p>He feared neither death nor its ministers; yet something like a
shudder possessed him as he held his breath and listened, but he heard
nothing but the thunder of the breakers against the cavern walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who speaks?&rdquo; he exclaimed, advancing a pace or two back
into the darkness.</p>
<p>A feeble moan, almost at his feet, was the response.</p>
<p>Stooping and peering intently before him, he distinguished what
seemed to be the outlines of a human form. Approaching and bending over
it, he caught the murmur of his own name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Kaala! Kaaialii is here!&rdquo; he cried, as he
tenderly folded her in his arms and bore her toward the opening.
Seating himself in the dim light, he pushed back the hair from her cold
face, and sought to revive her with caresses and words of endearment.
She opened her eyes, and, nestling closer to his breast, whispered to
the ear that was bent to her lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am dying, but I am happy, for you are here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sought to encourage her. He told her that he had come to save
her; that the gods, who loved her and would not let her die, had told
him where to find her; that he would take her to his home in Kohala,
and always love her as he loved her then.</p>
<p>She made no response. There was a sad smile upon her cold lips. He
placed his hand upon her heart, and found that it had ceased to beat.
She was dead, but he still held the precious burden in his arms; and
hour after hour he sat there on the gloomy shore of the cavern, seeing
only the pallid face of Kaala, and feeling only that he was
desolate.</p>
<p>At length he was aroused by the splashing of water within the cave.
He looked up, and Ua, the gentle and unselfish friend of Kaala, stood
before him, followed a moment after by Kamehameha. The method of
entering and leaving the cave was known to Keawe, and he imparted the
information to his sister. Ua first leaped into the whirlpool, and the
dauntless Kamehameha did not hesitate in following.</p>
<p>As the king approached, Kaaialii rose to his feet and stood sadly
before him. He uttered no word, but with bent head pointed to the body
of Kaala.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the king, softly; &ldquo;the poor girl is
dead. She <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427" name=
"pb427">427</a>]</span>could have no better burial-place. Come,
Kaaialii, let us leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kaaialii did not move. It was the first time that he had ever
hesitated in obeying the orders of his chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! would you remain here?&rdquo; said the king.
&ldquo;Would you throw your life away for a girl? There are others as
fair. Here is Ua; she shall be your wife, and I will give you the
valley of Palawai. Come, let us leave here at once, lest some angry god
close the entrance against us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great chief,&rdquo; replied Kaaialii, &ldquo;you have always
been kind and generous to me, and never more so than now. But hear me.
My life and strength are gone. Kaala was my life, and she is dead. How
can I live without her? You are my chief. You have asked me to leave
this place and live. It is the first request of yours that I have ever
disobeyed. It shall be the last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then seizing a stone, with a swift, strong blow he crushed in brow
and brain, and fell dead upon the body of Kaala.</p>
<p>A wail of anguish went up from Ua. Kamehameha spoke not, moved not.
Long he gazed upon the bodies before him; and his eye was moist and his
strong lip quivered as, turning away at last, he said: &ldquo;He loved
her indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wrapped in <i>kapa</i>, the bodies were laid side by side and left
in the cavern; and there to-day may be seen the bones of Kaala, the
flower of Lanai, and of Kaaialii, her knightly lover, by such as dare
to seek the passage to them through the whirlpool of Palikaholo.</p>
<p><i>Meles</i> of the story of the tragedy were composed and chanted
before Kamehameha and his court at Kealia, and since then the cavern
has been known as <i>Puhio-kaala</i>, or &ldquo;Spouting Cave of
Kaala.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the 1st of October, 1819, a fleet of four canoes
bearing the royal colors set sail from Kawaihae, in the district of
Kohala, on the northwestern coast of Hawaii. The canoes were large and
commodious, and were occupied by between sixty and seventy persons, a
portion of whom were females. The most of the men were large, muscular
and over six feet in height, while the dress and bearing of many of the
women indicated that they were of the <i>tabu</i> and chiefly
classes.</p>
<p>The costumes of a number of those of both sexes who seemed to be of
rank were a strange admixture of native and foreign fabric and fashion.
American and European manufactures were beginning to find a market in
the islands, and the persons of many were adorned with rich cloths,
jewelry and other tokens of civilization. Their weapons and utensils
were largely of metal, and a squad of ten warriors armed with muskets,
in one of the canoes, showed that the white man&rsquo;s methods of
warfare had received the early and earnest attention of the Hawaiian
chiefs and leaders.</p>
<p>The canoe leading the little squadron was double, with covered
apartments extending into and across the united decks of both, and the
persons occupying it, with the exception of soldiers, sailors and
servants, were distinguished alike for their gaudy trappings and a
boisterous merriment infusing a feeling of jollity throughout the
fleet. In this canoe was Liholiho, who, on the death of his
distinguished father, Kamehameha I., something less than five months
before, had become sole monarch of the Hawaiian group. In addition to
two of his queens, he was accompanied by Kapihe, the commander of the
royal vessels; Kekuanaoa, the royal treasurer, and a retinue of chiefly
friends and personal attendants. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb432"
href="#pb432" name="pb432">432</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the 8th of the previous May his royal father had died at Kailua,
leaving to Liholiho the kingdom his arms had won, with Kaahumanu as
second in authority and guardian of the realm. The morning following
the death of his father Liholiho left Kailua for Kohala to avoid
defilement, and there remained for ten days, when he returned to Kailua
and formally assumed the sceptre. At the end of the season of mourning,
for superstitious reasons the young king again left for Kohala, and
took up his residence for a time at Kawaihae. Remaining there until the
1st of October, on the advice of Kaahumanu he had started on his return
to Kailua.</p>
<div class="figure p432width" id="p432"><img src="images/p432.jpg" alt=
"Interior of an Ancient Temple." width="720" height="421">
<p class="figureHead">Interior of an Ancient Temple.</p>
</div>
<p>During the brief residence of Liholiho at Kawaihae, Kaahumanu
inaugurated a vigorous conspiracy against the priesthood, and resolved
to persuade the young king to repudiate the religion and <i>tabus</i>
of his fathers. In this scheme she was assisted by Keopuolani, the
mother of Liholiho; Kalaimoku, the prime minister, and Hewahewa, the
high-priest, who claimed descent from the renowned Paao.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the reign of the first Kamehameha the gods and
<i>tabus</i> of the priesthood began to lose something of their
sanctity in the estimation of the masses. Although the first Christian
missionaries to the islands did not arrive until nearly a year after
the death of Kamehameha I., many trading and war vessels had touched at
Hawaiian ports during the two preceding decades. No very clear idea of
the Christian religion had been imparted to the natives by the sailors
and traders with whom they had been brought in contact; but it could
not have escaped their observation that the foreigner&rsquo;s disregard
of the <i>tabu</i> brought with it no punishment, and they very
naturally began to question the divinity of a religious code limited in
its scope to the Hawaiian people.</p>
<p>The results of this growing scepticism were frequent violations of
the <i>tabu</i>. To check this seditious tendency summary punishments
were inflicted. A woman was put to death for entering the eating
apartment of her husband, and Jarvis relates that three men were
sacrificed at Kealakeakua, a short time before the death of
Kamehameha&mdash;one of them for putting on the <i>maro</i> of a chief,
another for eating a forbidden article, and the third for leaving a
house that was <i>tabu</i> and entering one that was not. Kamehameha
had learned something of the religion of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb433" href="#pb433" name=
"pb433">433</a>]</span>foreigners, but not enough to impress him
greatly in its favor; and when questioned concerning it during his last
illness he replied that he should die in the faith of his fathers,
although he thought it well that his successor should give the subject
attention.</p>
<p>Different motives influenced the leaders in this conspiracy against
the religion and <i>tabus</i> of the group. Kaahumanu, the favorite
wife of Kamehameha I., but the mother of none of his children, was
bold, ambitious and unscrupulous. Left second in authority under the
young king, she chafed at the restraints imposed by the <i>tabu</i>
upon her sex. Many of the most palatable foods were denied her by
custom, and in her intercourse with foreigners acts of courtesy were
chilled and hampered by numerous and irksome <i>tabu</i> interdictions.
To enable her to eat and drink of whatever her appetites craved, and to
do so in the presence of males, Kaahumanu was prepared to strike at the
roots of a religious system which had maintained her ancestors in place
and power, even though she had no definite knowledge of the new faith
with which she hoped to supplant it.</p>
<p>Although the uncle of one of the wives of
Liholiho&mdash;Kekauonohi&mdash;Kalaimoku was not of distinguished
rank. He was a chief of decided ability, however, and had been by
degrees advanced under the first Kamehameha, until he became the prime
minister of the second. Not being a <i>tabu</i> chief by birth, he was
easily persuaded by Kaahumanu to lend his assistance in depriving those
of higher rank of their <i>tabu</i> prerogatives, and to this end he
and his brother Boki were baptized by the Roman Catholic chaplain of
the French corvette <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;Uranie</i> shortly after the
assumption of the government by Liholiho. This was done while the young
king was residing at Kawaihae, and without his knowledge.</p>
<p>Keopuolani, the political wife of Kamehameha I., and the mother of
Liholiho, Kauikeaouli and Nahienaena, was the daughter of Kiwalao, and
of supreme <i>tabu</i> rank. So well was this recognized that her
distinguished husband, it is related, always approached her with his
face to the earth. She lacked decision of character, however, and her
adhesion to the conspiracy against the <i>tabu</i> was doubtless due to
the influence over her of the crafty Kaahumanu.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the motives of others, the apostasy
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name=
"pb434">434</a>]</span>of Hewahewa seems to have been the result of
conviction. Being the high-priest of Hawaii, he had everything to lose
and nothing to profit by the destruction of the religious system of
which he was the supreme and honored head. Of an inquiring mind, the
little knowledge he had gained of the new creed had convinced him of
the inconsistency of his own, and when the time came to strike he acted
boldly. His hand was the first to apply the torch to the temples. Had
he hesitated the conspiracy would have failed, for the influence of the
high-priest with the masses at that time was second only to that of the
king.</p>
<p>Liholiho was strong only in his attachments. Born in 1797, when the
group had been consolidated under one government and further wars were
not apprehended, he had not been given that austere and solid training
in civil and military life imparted to the princes of the previous
generation. He was attracted by the vices rather than the virtues of
the foreigners at intervals visiting the islands, and, realizing that
his future was secure, had devoted almost exclusively to pleasure the
ripening years of his youth. Light-hearted, affectionate and gentle, he
had shown so little taste for public affairs at the age of twenty-two
that his dying father, in bequeathing to him the sceptre, deemed it
prudent to accompany it with the condition that, should he wield it
unworthily, the supreme power should devolve upon Kaahumanu.</p>
<p>These were the prominent actors in the scheme for the destruction of
the priesthood, and this the character of the young king who had been
tarrying for some months at Kawaihae, and to whom a message had been
sent by Kaahumanu, informing him that, on his return to Kailua, she
would openly set the gods at defiance and declare against the
<i>tabu</i>. This information did not greatly astonish Liholiho. He
knew of the growing hostility to the <i>tabu</i>; had talked with
Hewahewa on the subject; had learned that his mother had failed to
respect it on late occasions, and had himself seen it violated without
harm to the offender. Yet he feared the consequences of an open
declaration against the priesthood. He remembered the fate of Hua,
whose bones whitened in the sun. He knew that his arrival at Kailua
would precipitate the crisis, and compel him either to renounce or
defend the gods of his fathers; and after leaving Kawaihae, as we have
seen, with a party occupying four canoes, he pursued his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name="pb435">435</a>]</span>way
very leisurely toward Kailua, seemingly in no haste to reach his
destination.</p>
<p>Moving southward, and passing the rocky point immediately north of
Puako, sail was shortened in the royal fleet, and the canoes drifted
slowly along the coast, taking just wind enough to hold their course.
Carousings were heard in the royal quarters. Liholiho appeared, and,
waving his hand to a group of men and women forward, a wild <i>hula</i>
dance was soon in progress, to the accompaniment of drums and rattling
calabashes. The king watched the dancers for some time with a vacant
air, and then began to mark the drum-beats with his feet. The emphasis
of the movement increased, until, dismissing his dignity, his voice
finally rose above the rude music, and he began to dance with an
enthusiasm which seemed to be almost frenzied. Others of the royal
party joined in the revelry, and for half an hour or more the vessel
was the scene of tumultuous merriment. Bottles and calabashes of
intoxicating liquors were then passed from one to another of the
companions of the king, and the <i>hula</i> was continued, followed by
chants, <i>meles</i> and other methods of enjoyment. Drinking was
frequent, and the humbler members of the party were sparingly supplied
with gin, whiskey and other stimulants. Similar scenes were transpiring
in the canoes following, and the debauch was the wildest ever witnessed
on any one of the eight Hawaiian seas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us make drunk the water-gods!&rdquo; exclaimed the king.
&ldquo;Here, Kuula, is a taste for you; and here, Ukanipo, is your
share!&rdquo; And he tossed into the ocean two bottles of liquor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope the gods may not be angered by the unusual
sacrifice,&rdquo; said Laanui, one of the favorite companions of the
king. He spoke seriously, and Liholiho&rsquo;s face wore a troubled
expression for a moment as he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have not yet lost faith in the gods,
Laanui?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the prompt answer of Laanui.</p>
<p>The king did not continue the conversation. Turning and beckoning to
a servant, more liquor was brought, after which the revelry was
continued all through the day and far into the night. Meanwhile, so
little progress had been made that at noon the next day the fleet was
off Kiholo.</p>
<p>For another twenty-four hours the feasting, drinking and dancing
continued, when the revelers were met by a double <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href="#pb436" name=
"pb436">436</a>]</span>canoe sent by Kaahumanu from Kailua in search of
the royal party. The messengers of his chief counselor were courteously
received by Liholiho, and, hoisting all sail, he was escorted by them
to Kailua, where he was warmly welcomed by Kaahumanu and the members of
the royal family.</p>
<p>Appearances of dissipation were plainly visible in the language and
bearing of the king, and Kaahumanu regarded the moment as auspicious
for committing him to some flagrant and public act of hostility to the
<i>tabu</i>. Both she and Keopuolani, the queen-mother, had been
secretly violating it, since the death of Kamehameha I., by eating of
foods interdicted to their sex, and to screen themselves from exposure
it was necessary that the religious system should be destroyed of which
the <i>tabu</i> was the vital force. This could be accomplished only
through the united efforts of the king and high-priest. Hewahewa was
prepared to do his part as the religious head of the kingdom, but the
young king, notwithstanding the pressure that had been brought to bear
upon him by Kaahumanu and a few of the leading chiefs of his court, was
still undecided.</p>
<p>A feast was prepared in honor of the king&rsquo;s return to Kailua.
In accordance with native custom, separate tables for the sexes were
spread, and a number of foreigners were present as the invited guests
of Kaahumanu. During the afternoon Liholiho, in response to
well-devised banters, had been induced to drink and smoke with the
female members of his family. This was a favorable beginning, and,
farther emboldened by his mother, who deliberately ate a banana in his
presence and drank the milk of a cocoanut, he declared that he would
openly set the <i>tabu</i> at defiance during the approaching
feast.</p>
<p>It was feared that his courage would fail, and he was not left to
himself for a moment until he led the way to the feast. His step was
unsteady, and his face wore a troubled expression as he proceeded to
the pavilion, accompanied by Kaahumanu, Keopuolani and other members of
the royal household. As they separated to take seats at their
respective tables, the queen-mother gave Liholiho a look of
encouragement, and Kaahumanu said to him in a low tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have the courage of your father, this will be a great
day for Hawaii.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king made no reply, for at that moment his eyes fell upon
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437" name=
"pb437">437</a>]</span>wooden images of Ku and Lono, on opposite sides
of the entrance, and he stepped briskly past them and seated himself at
the head of one of the tables. The sight of the idols almost unnerved
him, and some of the guests observed that his hand trembled as he
raised to his lips and drained a vessel of what seemed to be strong
liquor.</p>
<p>The guests were all seated. Hewahewa rose, and, glancing at the
troubled face of the king, lifted his hands and said with firmness:
&ldquo;One and all, may we eat in peace, and in our hearts give thanks
to the one and only god of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words of the high-priest restored the sinking courage of the
king. He rose from his seat, deliberately walked to one of the tables
reserved for the women, and seated himself beside his mother. During
the strange proceeding not a word was spoken, not a morsel touched.
Some believed him to be intoxicated; others were sure that he was
insane. Since the age of Wakea no one had so defied the gods and lived.
Many natives rose from the tables, and horror took the place of
astonishment when Liholiho, encouraged by his mother, began to freely
partake of the food prepared for the women. Interdicted fish, meats and
fruits were then brought to the tables of the women by order of the
king, who ate from their plates and drank from their vessels.</p>
<p>Now satisfied that the king was acting deliberately and with the
approval of the most influential dignitaries of the kingdom, including
the supreme high-priest, a majority of the chiefs present promptly
followed the example of their sovereign, and an indescribable scene
ensued. &ldquo;The <i>tabu</i> is broken! the <i>tabu</i> is
broken!&rdquo; passed from lip to lip, swelling louder and louder as it
went, until it reached beyond the pavilion. There it was taken up in
shouts by the multitude, and was soon wafted on the winds to the
remotest corners of Kona. Feasts were at once provided, and men and
women ate together indiscriminately. The <i>tabu</i> foods of palace
and temple were voraciously eaten by the masses, and thousands of women
for the first time learned the taste of flesh and fruits which had
tempted their mothers for centuries.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the royal feast a still greater surprise
bewildered the people. &ldquo;We have made a bold beginning,&rdquo;
said Hewahewa to the king, thus adroitly assuming a part of the
responsibility; &ldquo;but the gods and <i>heiaus</i> cannot survive
the death of the <i>tabu</i>.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb438" href="#pb438" name="pb438">438</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let them perish with it!&rdquo; exclaimed Liholiho, now
nerved to desperation at what he had done. &ldquo;If the gods can
punish, we have done too much already to hope for grace. They can but
kill, and we will test their powers by inviting the full measure of
their wrath.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="figureHead">Ancient Temple by the Sea-Shore, 1793.</p>
</div>
<p>To this resolution the high-priest gave his ready assent, and orders
were issued at once for the destruction of the gods and temples
throughout the kingdom. Resigning his office, Hewahewa was the first to
apply the torch, and in the smoke of burning <i>heiaus</i>, images and
other sacred property, beginning on Hawaii and ending at Niihau,
suddenly passed away a religious system which for fifteen hundred years
or more had shaped the faith, commanded the respect and received the
profoundest reverence of the Hawaiian people. No creed was offered by
the iconoclasts in lieu of the system destroyed by royal edict, and
until the arrival of the first Christian missionaries, in March of the
year following, the people of the archipelago were left without a
shadow of religious restraint or guidance.</p>

<h3 class="main">II.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While the abolition of the <i>tabu</i> system received
the universal approval of the masses, the destruction of the gods and
temples met with very considerable remonstrance and opposition. It was
believed by many that the priesthood might be preserved without the
<i>tabu</i>, and that the king had transcended his sovereign power in
striking down both at a single blow. Hence many gods were saved from
the burning temples, and thousands refused to relinquish the faith in
which they had been reared. Deprived of their occupations, the priests
denounced the destruction of the <i>heiaus</i>, and it was not long
before a formidable conspiracy against the government was organized on
Hawaii, under the leadership of Kekuaokalani, a chief of rare
accomplishments and a cousin of the king. Defection appeared at the
court, and several chiefs of distinction gave their support to the
revolutionary movement.</p>
<p>However it may be regarded in the light of its results, on the part
of Kekuaokalani the rebellion was a brave and conscientious defence of
the religion of his fathers. He raised the standard of revolt within a
day&rsquo;s march of Kailua, and invited to its support all who
condemned the action of Liholiho in decreeing the destruction
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439" href="#pb439" name=
"pb439">439</a>]</span>of the national religion. He scorned all
compromises and concessions, and but for the firearms of the whites
would doubtless have wrested the sceptre from his royal cousin.</p>
<p>It has been asserted that Kekuaokalani was ambitious and availed
himself of the discontent created by the anti-religious decrees of
Liholiho as a possible means of seizing the reins of government. This
assumption is not sustained either by the words or acts of the
unfortunate chief. The ambassadors sent to him after the first skirmish
of the conflict reported that he declined all terms of peaceful
settlement. This, however, was not the case. What he demanded was that
Liholiho should withdraw his edicts against the priesthood, permit the
rebuilding of the temples, and dismiss Kalaimoku as prime minister and
Kaahumanu as chief counselor of the government. These conditions were
declined, and the ambassadors returned with the story that they had
offered to leave the question of religion entirely with the people, but
that Kekuaokalani would have nothing but war. A correct statement of
what occurred at the interview would doubtless have weakened the royal
cause, and was therefore withheld. After the resignation of Hewahewa as
high-priest the position devolved upon Kekuaokalani by right of
precedence, and, believing in the sanctity of his gods, as a brave man
he could not do less than take up arms in their defence.</p>
<p>No characters in Hawaiian history stand forth with a sadder
prominence, or add a richer tint to the vanishing chivalry of the race,
than Kekuaokalani and his courageous and devoted wife, Manono, the last
defenders in arms of the Hawaiian gods. They saw all that the light
around them presented, but the only gods known to them were those of
their fathers, and they died in a futile effort to protect them. They
were brave, noble and conscientious, and the cause in which they
perished cannot detract from the grandeur or dim the glory of the
sacrifice.</p>
<p>In the veins of Kekuaokalani ran the best blood both of Hawaii and
Oahu. He was a nephew of Kamehameha I., and his strain was even
superior in rank to that of his distinguished uncle. His
great-grandmother was Kamakaimoku, a princess of Oahu, who became the
wife of Kalaninuiamamao, one of the sons of Keawe, king of Hawaii, and
the mother of Kalaniopuu, grandfather of Keopuolani, mother of
Liholiho. One of the full sisters of Kalaniopuu was Manona, the
grandmother of Kekuaokalani. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb440" href=
"#pb440" name="pb440">440</a>]</span></p>
<p>One of the early wives of Kamehameha I. was Kalola, a chiefess of
Hawaii. She subsequently became the wife of Kekuamanoha, a younger
brother of Kahekili, king of Maui, and the mother of Manono, wife of
Kekuaokalani. As the mother of Manono was a daughter of Kumukoa, one of
the sons of Keawe, king of Hawaii, and her father was a prince of Maui,
she was not only of high rank, but was related in blood both to her
husband and the reigning family.</p>
<p>Kekuaokalani is referred to by tradition as one of the most imposing
chiefs of his day. He was more than six and a half feet in height,
perfect in form, handsome in feature and noble in bearing. Brave,
sagacious and magnetic, he possessed the requirements of a successful
military leader; but as war had practically ceased with the conquest of
the group by Kamehameha I., and he had little taste for the frivolities
of the court, where he might have worn out his life in honored
idleness, he turned his attention to the priesthood. Beginning at the
bottom, with patient application he passed through the intervening
degrees until he stood beside the high-priest, fully his equal in
learning, and more than his peer in devotion to his calling. He
mastered the chronological <i>meles</i> of the higher priesthood and
the esoteric lore and secret symbols of the temple, and with the death
of Hewahewa it was the universal expectation that the duties of the
high-priesthood would devolve upon him. In disposition he was humane,
charitable and unselfish, and, appreciating the nobility of his
character, his wife worshipped him almost as a god. In return he
bestowed upon her the full measure of his affection, and the waters of
their lives flowed peacefully on together until the grave engulfed them
both.</p>
<p>This was the character of the sturdy chief around whom the friends
of the dethroned gods of Hawaii began to rally. He counseled peace and
submission so long as he could find listeners among the disaffected,
but in the end he was forced into the revolt and became the leader of
the movement.</p>
<p>He was present at the royal feast at Kailua when Liholiho publicly
violated the <i>tabu</i> and decreed the destruction of the temples. He
saw Hewahewa, the venerable high-priest, who had been to an extent his
religious guide and instructor, cast the first brand upon the
<i>heiau</i> where they had so often worshipped together and sought the
counsels of the gods. At first all this <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb441" href="#pb441" name="pb441">441</a>]</span>seemed to be a
horrible dream, but the burning temples and frantic rejoicings of the
populace soon convinced him that it was a bewildering reality, and he
threw himself to the earth and prayed that his sight might be blasted,
that he might witness no farther the sacrilegious acts of the
people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liholiho&rsquo;s brain is on fire with strong drink, and he
may be urged to do anything,&rdquo; thought Kekuaokalani; &ldquo;but
Hewahewa&mdash;it must be that he is insane, and it is my duty to speak
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sought and found the high-priest, and learned to his great grief
that Hewahewa was not only sound in mind, but was in thorough accord
with the king in his determination to destroy the temples and repudiate
the priesthood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, a high-priest of the blood of Paao, advise
this!&rdquo; said Kekuaokalani, bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I advise it,&rdquo; was the calm reply of Hewahewa;
&ldquo;but I am no longer the high-priest of Hawaii; the king has been
so notified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then here and now do I assume the vacant place,&rdquo;
returned Kekuaokalani, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whose appointment?&rdquo; inquired Hewahewa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the will of the outraged gods whose temples are turning to
ashes around us!&rdquo; replied Kekuaokalani, with energy. &ldquo;They
will teach me my duty, even should they fail to visit vengeance upon
their betrayers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words Kekuaokalani turned and walked away. His heart was
filled with anguish, and the shouts of the people drove him almost to
despair. Reaching the pavilion, he lifted and placed upon his shoulder
the prostrate and mutilated image of Lono that had stood beside the
entrance, and with the precious burden strode gloomily and defiantly
past the palace and disappeared.</p>
<p>For a month or more nothing was heard of Kekuaokalani at the court.
Meantime, the work of destruction continued, and the smoke of burning
temples rose everywhere throughout the group. At length word reached
Kailua that some of the priesthood, sustained by a number of
influential chiefs, were inciting a revolt in South Kono. Little
attention was paid to the report until it was learned that Kekuaokalani
had accepted the leadership of the movement. This alarmed the court,
and a council of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb442" href="#pb442"
name="pb442">442</a>]</span>chiefs was called. Discussion developed the
prevailing opinion that the threatened uprising was merely a local
disturbance that could be quelled without difficulty, and
Liholiho&rsquo;s apprehensions were further relieved by the assurance
of one of the chiefs that, with the assistance of forty warriors, he
would undertake to bring Kekuaokalani a prisoner to Kailua within three
days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with forty times forty!&rdquo; said Hewahewa, earnestly.
Better than any one else he understood and appreciated the lofty
courage of Kekuaokalani, and was too generous to listen to its
disparagement without protest. &ldquo;No, not with forty times
forty!&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Without Kekuaokalani the revolt will
amount to nothing; with him, it means war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then war let it be, since he invites it!&rdquo; exclaimed
Kalaimoku.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But may he not be persuaded to peace?&rdquo; inquired the
king, addressing the question, apparently, to Hewahewa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; replied the latter, &ldquo;if we are
prepared to accept his conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, think you, would be the conditions?&rdquo; returned the
king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The restoration of the <i>tabu</i> and the rebuilding of the
temples,&rdquo; was the deliberate answer of Hewahewa.</p>
<p>The king was silent; but before the council dissolved it was
understood that a force would be sent against the rebels at once, and
for a week or more preparations for the campaign were in progress,
under the supervision of Kalaimoku. Everything at length being in
readiness, the royal army, numbering, it is presumed, not less than
fifteen hundred warriors, some of them bearing firearms, moved
southward from Kailua in the direction of Kaawaloa, where had been
established the rebel headquarters.</p>
<p>Having accepted the leadership of the rebellion, and regarding
himself as a champion selected by the gods for their defence,
Kekuaokalani vitalized the movement with an energy and enthusiasm which
soon brought the people to its support in large numbers, and the winter
solstice found him in command of an army large enough to inspire him
with a reasonable hope of success.</p>
<p>The five intercalated days between the winter solstice and the
beginning of the new year had from time immemorial been set apart as a
season of <i>tabu</i>, dedicated to festivities in honor of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href="#pb443" name=
"pb443">443</a>]</span>Lono, one of the Hawaiian trinity. In the midst
of the general religious demoralization Kekuaokalani devoted to the
season its customary observances&mdash;the last yearly festival ever
authoritatively given to Lono in the group.</p>
<p>The movements of the government were regularly and rapidly reported
to Kekuaokalani, and when the royal troops left Kailua he was prepared
to meet them. Through his efforts a <i>heiau</i> near Kaawaloa had
escaped destruction. Thither he repaired, and, offering sacrifices to
the gods, prayed that they would manifest their power by giving him
victory.</p>
<p>He did not await the assault of the royal forces. Leaving Kaawaloa,
he attacked and defeated their advance not far north of that place,
throwing the entire army into confusion. Satisfied with the success, he
returned to Kaawaloa.</p>
<p>News of the repulse reaching Kailua, a consultation was called by
the king, and Kalaimoku urged the prompt advance of reinforcements by
land and sea, and an immediate and overwhelming attack upon the rebels
at Kaawaloa, rightly claiming that every day would add to the strength
of the insurgents under the inspiration of the slight victory they had
achieved.</p>
<p>This advice was accepted, and every available force was immediately
sent to the front, including a squadron of double canoes under the
command of Kaahumanu and Kalakua, one of them carrying a mounted swivel
in charge of a foreigner.</p>
<p>Uncertain as to the strength of the rebels, and by no means
confident of the results of a struggle which had opened in favor of his
enemies, Liholiho advised a resort to peaceful negotiations before
staking everything on the chances of battle. Hoapili, who stood in the
capacity of husband to the queen-mother, and Naihe, hereditary national
counselor and orator, were selected as ambassadors to confer with
Kekuaokalani, and Keopuolani volunteered to accompany them.</p>
<p>Reaching the camp of the insurgents, the ambassadors were graciously
received by Kekuaokalani, and used every means to effect an amicable
settlement of the difficulties that had brought two hostile armies face
to face; but nothing satisfactory could be accomplished. They were not
authorized to offer such terms as Kekuaokalani felt that he could
consistently accept, inasmuch as they failed to embrace either the
restoration of the <i>tabu</i> or the rebuilding of the temples. Naihe
offered to leave the question <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb444"
href="#pb444" name="pb444">444</a>]</span>of religion optional with the
insurgents. To this proposal Kekuaokalani bitterly replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You offer the scales of the fish after you have picked the
bones. As they are without temples, where would they worship? As they
are without altars, where would they sacrifice? As they are without the
<i>tabu</i>, what to them would be sacred and acceptable to the
gods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then must we take back the word that Kekuaokalani will have
nothing but war?&rdquo; said Keopuolani, sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, honored mother of princes,&rdquo; replied Kekuaokalani,
in a tone so solemn and impressive that his listeners stood awed in his
presence. &ldquo;Say, rather, that Kekuaokalani, the last high-priest,
it may be, of Hawaii, is prepared to die in defence of the gods to
whose service he has devoted his life. If they are omnipotent, as he
believes them to be, their temples will rise again; if not, he is more
than willing to hide his disappointment in the grave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naihe was his uncle; Kamakaimoku was the great-grandmother both of
Keopuolani and himself, and the king was his cousin. As a condition of
peace he demanded the recall of the edicts against the <i>tabu</i> and
the temples. As this could not be conceded, the ambassadors appealed to
his relationship with themselves and the royal family; but he could not
be moved. &ldquo;We are proud of our blood,&rdquo; he said to
Keopuolani, &ldquo;but who but the gods made kings of our
ancestors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finding that nothing could be effected, the ambassadors withdrew
with tokens of mutual regret, and were safely and respectfully escorted
beyond the rebel lines. The reports they allowed to be circulated on
their return, that Kekuaokalani had refused to consider any terms of
peace, and that they had narrowly escaped with their lives, were
inventions employed to mislead and exasperate the royal army.</p>
<p>With the departure of the ambassadors Manono sought her husband to
learn the results of the conference. The information that no agreement
had been reached did not surprise her. For weeks past all the auguries
had indicated blood, and the night before the <i>alae</i> had screamed
in the palms behind her hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank the gods for the omen!&rdquo; said Kekuaokalani.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the voice of the <i>alae</i> is a presage of evil,&rdquo;
suggested Manono. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb445" href="#pb445"
name="pb445">445</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Only to those who do evil,&rdquo; replied the chief.
&ldquo;The fate of the gods, whose battles we fight, is shaped by
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no fear of the result?&rdquo; inquired Manono.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear nothing,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;but the thought
has sometimes come to me of late that the gods are reserving for
Liholiho and his advisers a punishment greater than I may be able to
inflict. Should that be so, I am obstructing with spears the path of
their vengeance, and will be sacrificed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The will of the gods be done!&rdquo; said Manono, devoutly.
&ldquo;But, whatever may be the fate of Kekuaokalani, Manono will share
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave Manono!&rdquo; exclaimed the husband, with emotion.
&ldquo;If the gods so will it we will die together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night Kekuaokalani took up his line of march for Kailua,
determined to give battle to the royal forces wherever he might
encounter them. He moved near the coast, and the next morning the
hostile armies met at Kuamoo. Arranging his forces in order of battle,
Kekuaokalani sent to the front a number of newly-decorated gods in the
charge of priests, and, in turn addressing the several divisions,
conjured them in impassioned language to defend the gods of their
fathers.</p>
<p>Kalaimoku commanded the royal army in person. The battle opened in
favor of the rebels, and with them would have been the victory but for
the great superiority of the royalists in firearms. At a critical
juncture a battalion of musketeers, some of whom were foreigners,
charged the rebel centre, when the division gave way in something of a
panic, and soon the entire rebel forces were in retreat. Retiring to
the adjacent seaside, under cover of a stone wall they made a
successful resistance for some time; but the squadron of double canoes
already referred to, under the command of Kaahumanu and Kalakua,
enfiladed the position with musketry and a mounted swivel, and the
insurgents abandoned the unequal struggle, the most of them scattering
and seeking shelter in the neighboring hills.</p>
<p>Although wounded early in the action, Kekuaokalani gallantly kept
the field. Everywhere was his tall form seen moving throughout the
conflict, rallying and cheering his followers, while at his side fought
the brave Manono. He finally fell with a musket-ball through his heart.
With a wild scream of despair Manono sprang to his assistance, and the
next moment a bullet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href="#pb446"
name="pb446">446</a>]</span>pierced her temple, and she fell dead
across the body of her dying husband. Kalaimoku was the first to
approach, and gazing long upon the noble features of Kekuaokalani,
grand even in death, turned to his followers and said: &ldquo;Truly,
since the days of Keawe a grander Hawaiian has not lived!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus died the last great defenders of the Hawaiian gods. They died
as nobly as they had lived, and were buried together where they fell on
the field of Kuamoo.</p>
<p>Small bodies of religious malcontents were subdued at Waimea and one
or two other points, but the hopes and struggles of the priesthood
virtually ended with the death of Kekuaokalani. <span class=

<p class="h2main">THE TOMB OF PUUPEHE.</p>
<p class="h2sub">A LEGEND OF THE ISLAND OF LANAI.</p>
<p>Sailing along the lee-shore or southwest coast of Lanai, a huge
block of red lava, sixty feet in diameter and eighty or more feet in
height, is discerned standing out in the sea, and detached from the
mainland some fifty or sixty fathoms. The sides are precipitous,
offering no possible means of ascent, and against it the waves dash in
fury, and in the niches of its storm-worn angles the birds of ocean
build their nests. Observed from the overhanging bluff of the
neighboring shore, on the summit of the lonely column is seen a small
enclosure formed by a low but well-defined stone wall. This is known as
&ldquo;The tomb of Puupehe&rdquo;&mdash;the last resting-place of one
of the most beautiful of the daughters of Maui, whose body was buried
there by her distracted husband and lover, Makakehau, a warrior of
Lanai. How the summit was reached by the lover with his precious burden
is a mystery, but the wall is still there to show that the ascent was
made in some manner, and tradition assumes that it was through the
agency of supernatural forces.</p>
<p>Puupehe was the daughter of Uaua, a petty chief of Maui, and
Makakehau won her, it is related without detail, as the joint prize of
love and war. How this could have occurred it is difficult to imagine,
since Lanai was always a dependency of Maui in the past, and no direct
wars between the two islands are mentioned by tradition. It may
therefore be inferred that she was the spoil of some private predatory
expedition, and that the efforts of the young warrior to jealously
seclude her from the gaze of men were prompted not more by the
infatuations of her beauty than the fear that she might be
recaptured.</p>
<p>However this may have been, they are described in the
<i>Kanikau</i>, or &ldquo;Lamentation of Puupehe,&rdquo; as mutually
captive to each other in the bonds of love. The maiden was a sweet
flower of Hawaiian beauty. Her glossy brown and spotless <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb450" href="#pb450" name="pb450">450</a>]</span>body
&ldquo;shone like the clear sun rising out of Heleakala.&rdquo; Her
flowing hair, bound by wreaths of <i>pikaki</i> blossoms, streamed
forth as she ran &ldquo;like the surf-crests scudding before the
wind,&rdquo; and the starry eyes of the daughter of Uaua so dazzled the
youthful brave that he was called Makakehau, or &ldquo;Misty
Eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fearing that the radiant beauty of his captive might cause her to be
coveted by some of the chiefs of the land, he said to her: &ldquo;We
love each other well. Let us go to the clear waters of Kalulu. There we
will fish together for the <i>kala</i> and <i>bonita</i>, and there
will I spear the turtle. I will hide you, O light of my heart! in the
cave of Malauea. Or we will dwell together in the great ravine of
Palawai, where we will eat the young of the <i>uwau</i>, and bake them
in the <i>ti</i> leaf with the sweet <i>pala</i> root. The <i>ohelo</i>
berries of the Kuahiwa will refresh us, and we will drink of the cool
waters of Maunalei. I will thatch a hut in the thicket of Kaohai, and
we will love on till the stars die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>meles</i> tell of their loves in the Pulou Ravine, where they
caught the bright <i>iwi</i> birds and scarlet <i>apapani</i>. How
sweet were their joys in the <i>maia</i> groves of Waiakeakua, where
the lovers saw naught so beautiful as themselves! But the misty eyes
were soon to be made dimmer by weeping, and dimmer till the drowning
brine should shut out their light for ever.</p>
<p>Makakehau left his love one day in the cave of Malauea, while he
went to the mountain to fill the <i>huawai</i> with sweet water. This
cavern yawns at the base of the cliff overlooking the rock of Puupehe.
The sea surges far within, but there is an inner space or chamber which
the expert swimmer can reach, and where Puupehe had often found
seclusion, and baked the <i>honu</i>, or sea-turtle, for her absent
lover.</p>
<p>This was the season for the <i>kona</i>, the terrific storm that
comes up from the equator, and hurls the billows of ocean with
increased violence against the southern shores of the Hawaiian
Islands.</p>
<p>Makakehau beheld from the rocky springs of Pulou the vanguard of an
approaching <i>kona</i>&mdash;scuds of rain and thick mist rushing with
a howling wind across the round valley of Palawai. He knew the storm
would fill the cave with a wild and sudden rush of waters, and destroy
the life of his beautiful Puupehe.</p>
<p>Every moment was precious. He flung aside his calabashes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb451" href="#pb451" name=
"pb451">451</a>]</span>of water, and at the top of his speed started
down the mountain. With mighty and rapid strides he crossed the great
valley, where he met the coming storm in its fury. Over the rim he
dashed with an agonized heart, and down the ragged slope of the
<i>kula</i> to the shore, which the waves were already lashing in a
voice of thunder.</p>
<p>The sea was up, indeed! The yeasty foam of surging, wind-rent
billows whitened the cliffs, and the tempest chorussed the mad anthem
of the battling waves. Oh! where should Misty Eyes seek for his love in
the blinding storm?</p>
<p>A rushing mountain of sea fills the mouth of the cave of Malauea,
and the pent air within hurls back the invading torrent with a stubborn
roar, blowing outward great streams of spray. It is a savage war of the
elements&mdash;a battle of the forces of nature well calculated to
thrill with pleasure the hearts of strong men. But a lover looking into
the seething gulf of the whirlpool&mdash;what would be to him the
sublime conflict? what to see amid the boiling brine the upturned face
and tender body of the idol of his heart?</p>
<p>Others might agonize on the brink, but Misty Eyes sprang into the
dreadful caldron and snatched his lifeless love from the jaws of an
ocean grave.</p>
<p>The next day fishermen heard the lamentation of Makakehau, and the
women of the valley came down and wailed over Puupehe. They wrapped her
body in bright, new <i>kapa</i>, and covered it with garlands of
fragrant <i>nauu</i>. They prepared it for interment, and were about to
place it in the burial ground of Manele; but Makakehau prayed that he
might be left alone one night more with his lost love, and the request
was not refused.</p>
<p>When the women returned the morning following they found neither
corpse nor wailing lover. At length, looking toward the rock of
Puupehe, they discovered Makakehau at work on the lofty apex of the
lone sea-tower. The wondering people of the island watched him with
amazement from the neighboring cliffs, but, heedless of their
observation, he continued his labors. Some sailed around the base of
the column in their canoes, but could discover no means of ascent.
Every face of the rock was either perpendicular or overhanging.</p>
<p>The conviction then became general&mdash;since there seemed to be no
other possible explanation&mdash;that some sympathizing <i>akua</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb452" href="#pb452" name=
"pb452">452</a>]</span>or spirit, had responded to the prayer of
Makakehau, and assisted him in reaching the summit of the tower with
the body of his dead bride; and in this form has tradition brought down
the touching story.</p>
<p>Makakehau finished his labors. He laid his love in a grave prepared
by his own hands, placed the last stone upon it, and then stretched out
his arms and thus wailed for Puupehe:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><span class="corr" id="xd26e12240" title=
"Source: &lsquo;">&ldquo;</span>Where are you, O Puupehe?</p>
<p class="line">Are you in the cave of Malauea?</p>
<p class="line">Shall I bring you sweet water,</p>
<p class="line">The water of the fountain?</p>
<p class="line">Shall I bring the <i>uwau</i>,</p>
<p class="line">The <i>pala</i> and <i>ohelo</i>?</p>
<p class="line">Are you baking the <i>honu</i>?</p>
<p class="line">And the red, sweet <i>hala</i>?</p>
<p class="line">Shall I pound the <i>kalo</i> of Maui?</p>
<p class="line">Shall we dip in the gourd together?</p>
<p class="line">The bird and the fish are bitter,</p>
<p class="line">And the mountain water is sour.</p>
<p class="line">I shall drink it no more;</p>
<p class="line">I shall drink with Aipuhi,</p>
<p class="line">The great shark of Manele.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Ceasing his sad wail, Makakehau gazed for a moment
upon the grave where were buried the light and hope of his life, and
then leaped from the rock into the boiling surge at its base. His body
was crushed in the breakers. The witnesses of the sacrifice secured the
mangled remains of the dead lover, and interred them with respect in
the <i>kupapau</i> of Manele.</p>
<p>This is the story told by the old bards of Lanai of the lonely rock
of Puupehe, and the still inaccessible summit, with the marks of a
grave upon it, attests with reasonable certainty that: the <i>mele</i>
has something of a foundation in fact. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Early in the spring of 1885 a party of six or eight
ladies and gentlemen&mdash;the writer being of the number&mdash;made a
carriage circuit of the island of Oahu. Ample preparations for the
little journey had been made by the governor of the island, and the
marshal of the kingdom acted in the double capacity of guide and
escort. A score of attending natives accompanied the party on
horseback, and a delightful week or more was consumed in skirting the
breezy beaches of Koolau, in dalliance at Waialua, in visiting historic
points of interest, and in completing a journey of something less than
one hundred miles.</p>
<p>Starting from Honolulu, the empty carriages were carefully lowered
down the steep, ragged and narrow Pali road leading to the valleys
below, and the first evening found us at rest by the beautiful shores
of Kaneohe. Entering the district of Koolauloa the next day, and
approaching the coast over a broad stretch of grassy meadow but
slightly above the level of the ocean, our party was suddenly brought
to a halt beside a pool of clear water, nearly round, and perhaps a
hundred feet in diameter. The surface of the pool was ten or twelve
feet below the level of the surrounding plain, and its even banks of
solid rock dropped almost perpendicularly into water of unknown depth.
The volume of the pool is affected neither by rain nor drought, and the
native belief is that it is fed by springs at the bottom, and has a
subterranean drainage to the ocean, some two or three miles
distant.</p>
<p>This, we learned, was the celebrated pond of Waiapuka, around which
so many strange legends have been woven. All of them speak of a cavern
somewhere beyond the walls of the pool, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb456" href="#pb456" name="pb456">456</a>]</span>and to be reached
only by diving into the water and finding the narrow passage leading up
into it.</p>
<p>While listening to fragments of the story of Laieikawai and of other
legends connected with the mysterious cavern, and seriously doubting
the existence of the secret chamber so prominently referred to in the
early folk-lore of Oahu, an old native, who had joined the party at
Kaneohe, quietly and without a word dismounted, divested himself of his
upper garments and plunged into the pool. Swimming to the northern
wall, he clung for a moment to a slight projection, and then
disappeared. It was suggested for the first time that he was in search
of the cavern of Laieikawai, and all eyes were turned toward the point
where he was last seen above the water.</p>
<p>Three or four minutes elapsed, and fears for his safety began to be
exchanged, when the salutation of &ldquo;<i>aloha</i>!&rdquo; greeted
us from the opposite wall, and the next moment a pair of black eyes
were seen glistening through a small opening into the cavern, not
before observed, about four feet above the surface of the water.</p>
<p>The swimmer then returned to the pool by the passage through which
he had left it, and we were compelled to admit that the cavern of
Laieikawai was a reality, however wild and visionary may have been the
stories connected with it. Not a single person present, including the
governor, had ever before seen the passage to the cavern attempted, and
the natives were overjoyed at what they had witnessed.</p>
<p>To the many questions with which he was pressed the old man returned
but brief answers on his return, and when importuned to explain the
method of his entrance to the cavern, that the secret might not be
lost, he pointed significantly to the sea, and declared that there
would be found the bodies of those who sought to solve the mystery of
the passage and failed.</p>
<p>This rediscovery of the entrance to the cavern of Laieikawai created
a renewed interest in the legends associated with it, and thenceforth
during our journey many of the old stories were rehearsed. The most
interesting related to Laieikawai. It is a recklessly fanciful recital,
and gives expression to the extravagant conceits of the early Hawaiian
bards. Following is presented a condensation of the legend of
Laieikawai, as more elaborately told by Haleole.&mdash;<span class=

<h3 class="main">I.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The father of Laieikawai was Kahauokapaka, chief of
the two Koolau districts, comprising the entire windward side of the
island of Oahu, and her mother&rsquo;s name was Malaekahana. Soon after
their marriage he made a vow that if her children should prove to be
girls they were to be put to death, at least until a son should be born
to them.</p>
<p>In accordance with this savage vow the first four of
Malaekahana&rsquo;s children, all being daughters, were slain without
mercy. When her time again drew near, by the advice of a priest she
sent her husband to the coast to bring her some <i>ohua palemo</i>, a
small fish of which she was exceedingly fond.</p>
<p>In his absence she was delivered of twin girls, who were named
Laieikawai and Laielohelohe. They were surpassingly beautiful children,
and, desirous of saving their lives, the mother consigned the
first-named to the care of Waka, the child&rsquo;s grandmother, and the
other to Kapukaihaoa, a priest of discretion and sanctity.</p>
<p>On the return of the husband he was told that the expected child
came into the world without life. He knew that a birth in his house had
occurred during his absence, for he had heard two distinct claps of
thunder.</p>
<p>Waka took her foster-child to the cavern which opens into the pond
of Waiapuka, and which can be entered only by diving. Laielohelohe was
taken by her priestly protector to the sacred enclosure of Kukaniloko,
on the western side of the island, and there tenderly cared for.</p>
<p>The moment Waka entered the cavern of Waiapuka with Laieikawai a
rainbow appeared over the place, and was constantly visible so long as
the child remained there. Even when the sun was obscured by clouds the
rainbow could be seen.</p>
<p>At length the rainbow was observed by the great prophet Hulumaniani
on the distant island of Kauai. For twenty days in succession he saw
it, and knew its significance. He secured a canoe and fifteen men from
Poloula, the chief of Wailua, provided himself with a black pig, white
fowl and red fish for sacrifice, and, when the star Sirius rose, set
sail for Oahu.</p>
<p>Reaching that island, he landed at Waianae, and, guided by the
rainbow, in due time arrived at the pool of Waiapuka. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb458" href="#pb458" name="pb458">458</a>]</span>Waka
had just dived into the cave, and he noticed ripples on the water.
During the day Waka started to leave the cavern, but caught a glimpse
of the prophet sitting on the bank, and quickly returned, again
ruffling the water.</p>
<p>The prophet remained by the pool all night, and in the morning saw a
rainbow over Kukaniloko. Traveling in that direction, he ascended Mount
Kaala, when he saw the rainbow over the island of Molokai. Finding a
canoe bound thither, he took passage and landed at Haleolono, near the
western shore.</p>
<p>In a dream Waka had been directed by Kapukaihaoa to remove
Laieikawai to some securer place, and had accordingly taken her to
Malelewaa, a secluded spot on the north side of Molokai.</p>
<p>Following the rainbow, the prophet arrived in the evening at
Waikolu, just below Malelewaa; but that night Waka was again advised in
a dream to remove at once to the island of Hawaii and dwell with her
ward at Paliuli. They departed at dawn, and at Keawanui met a man
getting his canoe ready to sail to Lanai, and engaged passage; but
before they could embark Laieikawai accidentally removed the veil which
Waka compelled her to wear, and the man was amazed at her beauty.</p>
<p>Instead of starting for Lanai, he invited Waka and her ward to
remain at his house until he could secure the services of another
rower, and then started around the island, proclaiming to every group
of people the great beauty of Laieikawai.</p>
<p>A great crowd had assembled at Kalaupapa to witness a boxing-match,
and there the man extolled the beauty of the girl in the presence of
the head chief and the prophet in search of her. Not doubting that the
girl described was the one he was in quest of, the prophet proceeded to
Kawela and saw the rainbow over Hawanui. That night he arrived at
Kaamola, the land adjoining, and went to rest, for he had journeyed far
and was weary.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Waka, again warned in a dream, obtained a canoe and sailed
across the channel to Lanai, landing at Maunalei. Three days of fog and
rain followed, and on the fourth the prophet saw the rainbow over
Maunalei. It did not remain there, however. Ten days later he discerned
something peculiar on the high peak of Haleakala, on the island of
Maui. He proceeded thither, but found nothing there but fog and
rain.</p>
<p>He next journeyed to Kauwiki, a hill near Hana, and there
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb459" href="#pb459" name=
"pb459">459</a>]</span>erected a small <i>heiau</i>, or temple, for the
worship of his patron deity. After the dedication, seeing nothing on
Hawaii, and receiving no inspiration, he remained for some time at
Kauwiki.</p>
<p>At length, in the early days of the seventh month of the year, he
saw faintly with the rising of the sun a rainbow on the windward side
of Hawaii. At sunset on the third day of the next month he entered his
<i>heiau</i> and prayed fervently, and there appeared before him the
wraiths of Waka and Laieikawai. His patron god then informed him that
the persons whose shadows he had seen were living in the forest of
Puna, in a house thatched with the yellow feathers of the
<i>oo</i>.</p>
<p>With this information the prophet set sail for Mahukona, on the
island of Hawaii. There he prayed in the temple of Pahauna, and was
directed to Waipio, where he offered sacrifices in the famous
<i>heiau</i> of <i>Paakalana</i>. He proceeded thence to Kaiwilahilahi,
near Laupahoehoe, where he remained for some years, unable to obtain
any further information of the persons of whom he was in search.</p>

<h3 class="main">II.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was during the sojourn of Hulumaniani, the prophet,
at Kaiwilahilahi, that Kauakahialii, king of Kauai, with his queen,
Kailikelauokekoa, returned from a wedding tour of the group. A great
assemblage of chiefs and commoners had met to welcome them home with
music, dancing and other festivities.</p>
<p>In relating his adventures the king referred to a meeting with the
mysterious princess of Paliuli, whose beauty, he declared, was
something more than human. The meeting occurred at Keaau, in Puna. The
<i>kahu</i> of the king first met the princess and her companion, and,
when requested by him to favor his royal master with a visit, the
princess informed him that she might possibly comply with his request
the night following. &ldquo;If I come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will
give you warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, listen and heed,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;If you
hear the voice of the <i>ao</i> I am not in its notes, and when you
hear the caw of the <i>alala</i> I am not in its voice. When the notes
of the <i>elepaio</i> are heard I am getting ready to descend. When you
hear the song of the <i>apapane</i> I shall have come out of my house.
Listen, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb460" href="#pb460" name=
"pb460">460</a>]</span>then, and if you hear the <i>iiwipolena</i>
singing I am outside of your house. Come forth and meet me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it came to pass. In the <i>kihi</i>, or first watch of the
evening, resounded the cry of the <i>ao</i>, in the second watch the
caw of the <i>alala</i>, at midnight the chirruping of the
<i>elepaio</i>, in the <i>pili</i> of the morning the song of the
<i>apapane</i>, and at daybreak the voice of the <i>iiwipolena</i>.
Then a shadow fell on the door, &ldquo;and we were enveloped,&rdquo;
said the king, &ldquo;in a thick fog, and when it cleared away the
princess was seen in her glorious beauty, borne on the wings of
birds.&rdquo; The name of the divine being, he said, was
Laieikawai.</p>
<p>Among the chiefs who listened to this story of the king was
Aiwohikupua, chief of Wailua, who was of foreign birth. He had made a
vow that he would not marry a Hawaiian woman, and, expressing the
opinion that the princess described by the king was a daughter of other
lands, he resolved to make her his wife.</p>
<p>To this end he sought out the late <i>kahu</i> of the king and made
him his confidant and chief officer. They talked of little else than
Laieikawai. He had a vision of her in a dream, and drank <i>awa</i>
successively for many days, in the hope of inspiring a repetition of
the vision. He chanted a <i>mele</i> in praise of the unknown princess,
renewed his resolution to possess her, and then prepared to go to
Hawaii in search of her.</p>
<p>He fitted out two double canoes, with sixteen rowers and two
steersmen, and, when the augurs and soothsayers declared the omens
favorable, on the rising of Sirius he set sail for Hawaii. On his way
thither he stopped at many places, and at length arrived in the harbor
of Haneoo, in the district of Hana, Maui.</p>
<p>A number of surf-riders were amusing themselves on the beach, among
them Hinaikamalama, the famous chiefess of Hana. Aiwohikupua was
smitten with her charms, and accepted her invitation to join the
bathing party in their sports. In turn she became enamored of him, and
invited him to visit her house and play <i>konane</i>&mdash;a game
resembling draughts&mdash;with her.</p>
<p>When about to begin the game she asked him what he was willing to
wager on his success, and he pointed to one of his double canoes. She
declined the condition, and proposed, instead, that they should stake
their persons. To this he agreed, and, playing, lost the game. To avoid
paying the forfeit he declared <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb461"
href="#pb461" name="pb461">461</a>]</span>that he had made a vow to
give himself in love to no woman until after he had made the circuit of
the island of Hawaii, and admonished her to remain faithful to him
while he was absent.</p>
<p>The chief and his party left Haneoo, and the next day arrived at
Kauhola, in the district of Kohala, Hawaii, where a boxing-match was in
progress. Aiwohikupua was challenged to a contest by Ihuanu, the
champion of Kohala. The challenge was accepted, and in the struggle
Ihuanu was killed.</p>
<p>They next landed at Paauhau, in Hamakua, to witness another
boxing-match. The local champion was Haunaka. He was invited to a
contest with Aiwohikupua, but, learning something of the prowess of the
chief, he declined the conflict. They then sailed for Laupahoehoe,
where the prophet Hulumaniani was still residing.</p>
<p>That evening the prophet was watching the clouds for omens, and
discerned in them that a chief&rsquo;s double canoe was approaching,
bearing nineteen men. The next morning he saw a mist on the sea, and
prepared his black pig, white fowl and bunch of awa. Then followed
peals of thunder, and Aiwohikupua&rsquo;s canoes came in sight, with
the <i>puloulou</i> insignia of a chief; whereupon the prophet offered
sacrifices, and prayed for the chief and himself.</p>
<p>Landing, the chief and prophet embraced, and spent the night
together, but Aiwohikupua did not disclose the real object of his
voyage. They then sailed for Makahanaloa, from which place could be
seen the rainbow over Paliuli. They landed at Keaau, where the people
were surf-bathing.</p>
<p>In the evening Aiwohikupua left his men with the canoes, taking with
him only his confidant, the <i>kahu</i>, carrying a rich feather mantle
as a present to the lady of Paliuli. After a long and wearisome journey
through the thick jungle they heard the crowing of a cock, and soon
after came to a clearing, at the farther end of which was the house of
Laieikawai, all covered with the choice yellow feathers of the
<i>oo</i><span class="corr" id="xd26e12628" title=
"Not in source">.</span></p>
<p>Aiwohikupua was amazed and humiliated. Said he: &ldquo;I brought my
royal feather cloak as a present to her, and behold! it is not equal to
the thatch of her house!&rdquo; Then turning to his <i>kahu</i>, he
said: &ldquo;I will stay here no longer. Let us return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the remonstrances of his companion, Aiwohikupua returned
to Keaau without seeing Laieikawai, and sailed at once <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb462" href="#pb462" name="pb462">462</a>]</span>for
Kauai. They did not stop to visit the prophet at Laulapahoehoe. When
off the coast of Hamakua they saw a woman of extraordinary beauty
reclining on a cliff by the shore. She was graceful in every movement,
and wore a snow-white mantle.</p>
<p>They landed and made her acquaintance. Her name was Poliahu, of
Mauna Kea. As usual, the chief began to talk to her at once of love. In
reply she asked him if he had not sworn by the names of his gods not to
marry a woman born on the Hawaiian group, and whether he had not
engaged himself to Hinaikamalama, of Hana. She informed him that, like
himself, she too was of <i>kupua</i> descent and possessed supernatural
powers. She promised to marry him, however, so soon as he could be
released from his oath and would return to claim her. She accompanied
them as far as Kohala, where she exchanged mantles with the chief in
pledge of their betrothal, and then took her departure.</p>
<p>Crossing the channel to Maui, the chief put into the harbor of
Haneoo, but did not land. Hinaikamalama hailed him from the shore, and
demanded the fulfilment of his promise; but he beguiled her by
declaring that he had not yet completed the circuit of Hawaii, having
sailed only along the windward side of it, and that bad news from home
compelled his immediate return to Kauai.</p>
<p>She believed him and was pacified. In the middle of the Oahu channel
he enjoined secrecy on his crew, and then hastened to Kauai, fully
determined to return to Hawaii and secure an audience with the princess
of Paliuli.</p>
<p>Reaching home, he informed his five sisters of what he had seen at
Paliuli, and they agreed to accompany him to Hawaii and assist him in
his suit with the beautiful Laieikawai.</p>
<p>The next day Aiwohikupua selected a fresh crew of fourteen rowers
and two pilots, who, with his sisters and confidential counselor, made
a party of twenty-three in all, and set sail for Hawaii. They were
detained a month at Honuaula, Maui, by stormy weather, but finally
reached Kaelehuluhulu, in the district of Kona, Hawaii. Poliahu saw
their canoes there, and was disappointed when they left for Hilo.</p>
<p>They arrived at Keaau, in Puna, about the middle of the day, and
Aiwohikupua made his arrangements and started inland at once with his
five sisters and trusted <i>kahu</i>. At midnight the party reached
Paliuli. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb463" href="#pb463" name=
"pb463">463</a>]</span></p>
<p>The chief stationed his eldest sister, Maile-haiwale, at the door of
Laieikawai. She sent forth the delicate fragrance of the plant of her
name, which awoke Laieikawai.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waka! Waka!&rdquo; exclaimed the princess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; answered Waka. &ldquo;What wakes you in the
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fragrance, a strange, cool fragrance, which goes to my
heart,&rdquo; returned the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a strange fragrance,&rdquo; said Waka. &ldquo;It is
certainly Maile-haiwale, the sweet-scented sister of Aiwohikupua, who
has come to ask you to be his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! I will not marry him,&rdquo; was the petulant response
of Laieikawai.</p>
<p>Aiwohikupua heard her refusal, and was so thoroughly disheartened
that he proposed to abandon his sisters and return to Keaau, but his
trusty <i>kahu</i> intervened and advised another trial. So the next in
age, Maile-kaluhea, took a position by the door. Her fragrance was
different and more penetrating; but nearly the same exchange of words
as before occurred within the house.</p>
<p>The chief again proposed to leave, but the <i>kahu</i> insisted on
trying the powers of Maile-laulii; but no better success followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try again,&rdquo; said the counselor, &ldquo;and if they all
fail I myself will undertake to persuade her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Maile-pakaha was sent to the door, but with no better result,
and, speaking loudly enough to be heard without, Laieikawai said:
&ldquo;Whoever may come, I will not consent to marry
Aiwohikupua.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this, and regarding any further attempt as useless,
Aiwohikupua ordered his sisters to remain behind in the woods as a
punishment for their failure, and started on his return to the coast.
The youngest sister, whose powers had not been tried, called after him
and touched his heart. He offered to take her and leave the rest
behind, but she would not consent to abandon her sisters. One of them
chanted a <i>mele</i> to soften his heart, but he remained
obdurate.</p>
<p>He proceeded to the coast, the sisters following as best they could,
and when they saw him and his attendants seated in the canoes and ready
for departure, Maile-kaluhea chanted a touching <i>mele</i>; but he
heeded it not and put out to sea.</p>
<p>The sisters traveled by land and met Aiwohikupua as he was about to
go ashore at Punahoa, but he avoided them by again <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb464" href="#pb464" name=
"pb464">464</a>]</span>setting sail. They then traveled overland to
Honolii, where their brother had stopped for supplies. They watched
during the night, and when Aiwohikupua was about to embark in the
morning his sisters drew near, and Kahalaomapuana chanted a pathetic
song, and with so great effect that her brother invited her into his
canoe, placed her on his knee and wept over her.</p>
<p>Ordering his rowers to pull out to sea with his youngest sister,
whom he still held in his embrace, she begged him to return for the
others, and when he refused she chanted a farewell song, leaped
overboard and swam ashore.</p>
<p>The sisters then decided to return to Paliuli, scarcely knowing
where else to go on the island of Hawaii, where they were strangers.
Arriving there, they found shelter in a clump of <i>hala</i> trees near
the house of Laieikawai, the doors of which were kept continually
closed. Failing to attract the attention of the inmates, the sisters
concluded to keep a fire burning at night and to sing by
turns&mdash;Maile-haiwale the first night, Maile-kaluhea the second,
and so on for four nights; but no notice was taken of them.</p>
<p>On the fifth night it was the turn of the youngest sister to sing.
She lighted the fire, made a musical instrument of a <i>ti</i> leaf and
played upon it. She did this in the evening and morning watches for two
nights. Laieikawai had never heard the instrument before, and it
delighted her. So she sent her <i>kahu</i>, a hunchback, to first spy
out the musician, and then bring before her the person who was capable
of making such music.</p>
<p>Following the <i>kahu</i>, Kahalaomapuana found Laieikawai resting
on the wings of birds, with two <i>iiwipolenas</i> perched upon her
shoulders. She was kindly received, played before her, and told her of
her sisters. Touched by the recital, Laieikawai ordered a house to be
built for them, and formally adopted them as her companions and guards.
They were fed by birds and lived as in an enchanted bower.</p>
<p>On the return to Kauai of Aiwohikupua from his second voyage he had
a great feast prepared, and all the guests were made drunk on
<i>awa</i>. Under the influence of the liquor Aiwohikupua divulged the
secret of his mission to Hawaii, and told all about his unsuccessful
efforts in seeking to secure an interview with the princess of
Paliuli.</p>
<p>Hauailiki, a handsome young chief of Mana, rose to his feet and
boasted that he could achieve without difficulty what Aiwohikupua
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb465" href="#pb465" name=
"pb465">465</a>]</span>had failed to accomplish; whereupon the latter
offered to furnish him with a canoe and men to sail it if he would
undertake to make good his boast, and each made a wager of his lands on
the result.</p>
<p>Hauailiki set sail for Hawaii the next day, and on his arrival at
Keaau was greatly admired for his manly beauty. The following morning a
dense fog enveloped the place, and when it cleared away he saw seven
women sitting by the seaside, one of whom was Laieikawai.</p>
<p>To attract her attention Hauailiki for four successive days appeared
before her in the surf, performing many difficult feats of swimming and
diving, but she gave him no heed. On the fifth day he exhibited his
skill in surf-swimming, and won applause from all but Laieikawai. He
then showed himself as a surf-swimmer without a board. His skill was
then recognized by Laieikawai, and she beckoned him to approach, and
threw around his neck a <i>lei lehua</i>, or garland of <i>lehua</i>
blossoms. Immediately the fog settled down, and when it cleared
Laieikawai and her party had left for Paliuli.</p>
<p>Hauailiki and his guide determined to follow the party at once, and,
traveling all night, they reached Paliuli in the morning. Approaching
the house, they were met by Maile-haiwale, the first sentinel, who
ordered them to retire. But they passed her by force, as they did the
second, third and fourth guards, until they met Kahalaomapuana near the
door of the house, resting on the wings of birds. She ordered them
back, threatening that the birds should pick their bones, and they
returned in haste to Keaau.</p>
<p>Undecided what course to pursue, Hauailiki dreamed of meeting
Laieikawai several nights in succession, and at last resolved to visit
Paliuli again and without an attendant. Reaching the spot, he
approached the house by a back path without encountering the sentinels,
and found Kahalaomapuana asleep at the door. He pushed aside the
feather curtain, entered the room, and found Laieikawai asleep, resting
on the wings of birds. He awoke her, and she ordered him away. He
pleaded with her and told her of his dreams, but she insisted upon his
departure. Kahalaomapuana then came to the assistance of her mistress,
and drove the importunate suitor back to Keaau.</p>
<p>Abandoning the undertaking as hopeless, Hauailiki returned
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb466" href="#pb466" name=
"pb466">466</a>]</span>to Kauai. Arriving at Wailua, he was welcomed by
a large gathering of chiefs, and when he had told his story Aiwohikupua
generously forgave him his wager.</p>
<p>Rejoiced to learn that his sisters had become the attendants of
Laieikawai, Aiwohikupua resolved to revisit Paliuli. He assembled a
fleet of twenty double and thirty single canoes, forty <i>peleleus</i>
for his attendants, and a triple canoe for himself and counselor, and
set sail for Hawaii.</p>
<p>Waka knew of the arrival of the fleet at Keaau, and admonished
Laieikawai not to visit the coast. The sisters were put on guard, and
Kahalaomapuana summoned to their defence their terrible patron god
Kihanuilulumoku, a <i>moo</i>, or gigantic lizard.</p>
<p>The night following these preparations Aiwohikupua and his guide
made their appearance at Paliuli. Five <i>tabu</i> sticks, covered with
white <i>kapa</i>, had been set at intervals beyond the house; but the
invaders disregarded them and pushed on, until they encountered
Maile-haiwale, the first sentinel. She ordered them to retire, and sent
a bird to summon the rest of her sisters. The youngest came, borne on
the wings of birds, and drove her brother back, telling him that they
were no longer sisters of his.</p>
<p>Aiwohikupua returned to Keaau, resolved to secure by force what he
had been unable to effect by strategy. He therefore sent up to Paliuli
a detachment of ten warriors, but they were promptly slain by the
lizard god. After waiting for two days he sent another detachment of
twenty warriors, with a competent officer, and all of them shared the
same fate. He next sent forty men, and still other forties, until eight
forties in all had perished.</p>
<p>He next despatched his two swift messengers to inquire about the
fate of his warriors. They met a bird-catcher above Olaa, who told them
of the <i>moo</i> and his dreadful work. Presently they heard the
roaring of the wind and the crash of falling trees, and the monster
appeared in the path before them. They reassumed their bird forms,
however, and escaped by flying.</p>
<p>Aiwohikupua then summoned Kalahumoku, the man-eating dog from
Kahiki, to kill the <i>moo</i> and bring to him Laieikawai; and with
the dog he sent his two bird messengers, to bring him early tidings of
the result.</p>
<p>As the two monsters met, a column of fog rose and drifted toward the
sea. This warned Aiwohikupua that the dog had been defeated. Late in
the day the animal returned, badly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb467"
href="#pb467" name="pb467">467</a>]</span>wounded and with ears and
tail missing, and the whole party set sail for Kauai.</p>
<p>Arriving home, Aiwohikupua thought of his engagement with the
beautiful Poliahu, and began to perform certain expiatory rites to
relieve himself of the oath he had taken not to marry a woman of the
Hawaiian Islands. He then sent his two bird messengers to Poliahu, to
inform her that he was preparing to fulfil his engagement.</p>
<p>By mistake the birds flew to Hana. They inquired for the betrothed
of the Kauai chief, and were directed to Hinaikamalama. They informed
her that three months were to be spent in preparation, and that in the
fourth month, in the night of <i>kulu</i>, Aiwohikupua would come to
claim his bride. These were the words they had been instructed to speak
to Poliahu, but by mistake they were told to another, who joyously
replied: &ldquo;He remembers, then, the game of <i>konane</i> which we
played together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the return of the bird messengers the blunder was discovered, and
they were banished from the court. Then the <i>koae</i>, or tropic
bird, was sent to Poliahu with the same message with which the others
had been entrusted.</p>
<p>Aiwohikupua, relieved of his oath, waited until the 24th day of the
third month, and then set sail in great state, with forty double and
eighty single canoes, and twenty <i>peleleus</i>. On the 11th day of
the fourth month he arrived at Kawaihae, and despatched the <i>koae</i>
to inform Poliahu, who named Waiulaula as the place for the
marriage.</p>
<p>To give brilliancy to the ceremony Aiwohikupua dressed his petty
chiefs, male and female, in feather cloaks, and many of his female
attendants in fine mats. He wore the white mantle given to him by
Poliahu, and a red feather helmet. His rowers were clad in fine red
<i>kapas</i>. On the platform of the chief&rsquo;s double canoe was
raised an <i>anu</i>, covered with yellow cloaks, and above it stood
the <i>tabu puloulou</i>. Around this canoe were ten others, carrying
musicians skilled in playing the <i>hula</i> drum and other
instruments.</p>
<p>On the day of <i>kulu</i> the three great mountains were covered
with snow, which was the sign promised by Poliahu. On the arrival of
Aiwohikupua and his party at Waiulaula they were met by Poliahu,
Lilinoe, Waiau and Kahoupokane, the three latter being mountain
goddesses. The men suffered from cold <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb468" href="#pb468" name="pb468">468</a>]</span>but on being apprised
of the fact Poliahu and her friends removed their snow mantles, causing
the snow on the mountains to retire to its usual limits.</p>
<p>Aiwohikupua and Poliahu were then made man and wife. Feasting and
music followed, and the happy pair returned together to Kauai, making
their residence above Honopuwai.</p>
<p>In revenge for their dismissal the banished bird messengers informed
Hinaikamalama of the marriage of her betrothed. Angered at his perfidy,
she persuaded her parents to make a visit with her to Kauai.</p>
<p>There was a gathering of chiefs at Mana, Kauai, to celebrate the
nuptials of Hauailiki and Makaweli. The night was spent in games,
dancing and other pastimes. A game of <i>kilu</i> was in progress. At
midnight Hinaikamalama entered the <i>kilu</i> shed and sat down among
the circle of players. Observing her, Hauailiki requested the <i>mea
ume</i> (drawer) to tell Aiwohikupua to stop the <i>hula kaeke</i> and
take part in the game of <i>kilu</i>, in order to enable him to make
her his prize. Accordingly, when Hauailiki won at the game, the <i>mea
ume</i> went around the circle and threw the <i>maile</i> wreath over
him. The wreath was then removed and placed over the shoulders of
Hinaikamalama. She rose to her feet and requested permission to speak.
She asked in whose honor the festival was being given, and, on being
informed of the occasion, requested Hauailiki to delay the fulfilment
of the <i>ume</i>, and then proceeded to tell her story of the
faithlessness of Aiwohikupua.</p>
<p>The story created a great sensation, and the conduct of Aiwohikupua
was universally condemned. Poliahu was enraged and returned to Mauna
Kea, and the chief agreed to fulfil his engagement with Hinaikamalama.
The night of their marriage Poliahu sent the chill of her snow mantle
upon her rival, and she was benumbed with cold. Her teeth chattered,
and it was with difficulty that she could be kept from freezing.</p>
<p>A second time, when she and Aiwohikupua came together, an intense
chill came over her. She was frightened, and inquired the cause. The
chief answered: &ldquo;The cold is sent by your rival. Betake you at
once to a fire, that you may not perish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day at noon they met, as had been previously arranged.
Poliahu put on her sun mantle, and a scorching heat almost consumed her
rival. Again they met, but were unable to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb469" href="#pb469" name="pb469">469</a>]</span>remain together, and
Hinaikamalama unceremoniously left Kauai, without even touching noses
with Aiwohikupua.</p>
<p>Before she left for Maui, however, a <i>kilu</i> game was arranged
at Puuapapai, and Hauailiki, still mindful of his success at Mana,
endeavored to secure the fruits of his victory. But Hinaikamalama
refused to yield, unless the victor would come to Hana in proper state
and formally make her his wife.</p>
<p>During the game Poliahu and her companions appeared in glittering
robes of snow and chilled the assemblage, and the next morning they
returned to Mauna Kea, while Hinaikamalama set sail for Hana.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The king and queen of Kauai both dying a short time
after the events just before recorded, they left the sovereignty of the
island to their son, Kekalukaluokewa. They also left in his charge a
magical bamboo (<i>ohe</i>) called Kanikawi, and enjoined upon him a
promise to seek out and marry Laieikawai, of whom many reports had
reached Kauai.</p>
<p>The new king ordered an immense fleet of canoes for his trip to
Hawaii, and sailed in the month of <i>Mahoemua</i>, or August. At
Makahanaloa he saw the rainbow over Keaau, and sailed thither. Waka
foresaw his coming and advised Laieikawai to marry him and become the
queen of a whole island.</p>
<p>After waiting four days Laieikawai and her <i>kahu</i>, the
hunchback, went down to Keaau, and watched the king and his two
favorite companions sporting in the surf. They knew the king by his not
carrying his own surf-board when he landed. She returned to Paliuli and
informed Waka that she would accept him for a husband.</p>
<p>Waka then arranged that Kekalukaluokewa should go at sunrise the
next morning and play in the surf alone; that a dense fog should settle
down, under cover of which Laieikawai would join him in the surf; that
when the fog raised the two would be seen by all riding in together on
the same roller, and then they were to touch noses. A fog would again
envelop them, and then birds would bear the pair to Paliuli. She was
forbidden to speak to any one after leaving the house.</p>
<p>Now, it appears that Halaaniani, a young man of Puna, noted
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb470" href="#pb470" name=
"pb470">470</a>]</span>for his debaucheries, had often seen Laieikawai
at Keaau, and ardently longed to possess her. Learning that she was
about to marry the king of Kauai, he implored his sister, Malio, to
exert her magical powers in his behalf. She consented, and by her
direction they both went to sleep, and when they awoke related to each
other their dreams. She dreamed that she saw a bird building a nest and
leaving it in the possession of another, which was a sure omen in favor
of Halaaniani. Malio declared that her magic powers would prevail over
those of Waka, and gave her brother minute instructions, which he
strictly observed, as will appear.</p>
<p>They went to the beach and saw Kekalukaluokewa swimming alone in the
surf. Soon the fog of Waka settled down on the land. A clap of thunder
was heard as Laieikawai reached the surf. A second peal resounded,
invoked by Malio. The fog lifted, and three persons instead of two were
seen in the surf. This was noted with surprise on shore.</p>
<p>When the first roller came the king said, &ldquo;Let us go
ashore,&rdquo; and he rode in on the breaker with Laieikawai, while
Halaaniani remained behind. At that moment the king and his companion
touched noses. Three times they rode in on the waves, while Halaaniani,
as directed by his sister, remained outside among the rollers.</p>
<p>The fourth time Laieikawai asked the king why he desired to repeat
the sport so often. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am not
used to the short surf; I prefer to ride on the long rollers.&rdquo;
The fifth was to be the last time for the Kauai king and his promised
bride.</p>
<p>As soon as the two started for the shore Halaaniani seized
Laieikawai by the feet and held her back, so that the surf-board
slipped from her grasp, and Kekalukaluokewa was borne to the shore
without her. She complained of the loss of her surf-board, and it was
restored to her.</p>
<p>Halaaniani persuaded her to swim farther out to sea with him,
telling her not to look back, as he would let her know when they
reached <i>his</i> surf. After swimming for some time she remonstrated,
but he induced her to continue on with him. At last he told her to look
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said she, in amazement, &ldquo;the land is out of
sight, and Kumukahi, the sea-god, has come to stir the waves!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb471" href="#pb471" name=
"pb471">471</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the surf of which I told you,&rdquo; he replied;
&ldquo;we will wait and go in on the third roller. Do not in any case
let go of your surf-board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he prayed to his patron deity, and the breakers began to rise.
As the third came thundering on, he exclaimed, &ldquo;<i lang="haw">Pae
kaua!</i>&rdquo; and, mounting the roller, they started for the shore.
Laieikawai was in the overhanging arch of the wave, and, looking up,
saw Halaaniani poised with great skill on the crest. At that moment she
began to yield to the seductive fascination of Halaaniani.</p>
<p>As they came in, Waka supposed her companion to be Kekalukaluokewa,
and she sent down the birds in the fog; and when it cleared away
Laieikawai and Halaaniani were occupants of the feather-house at
Paliuli, where their union was consummated.</p>
<p>Waka wondered why her granddaughter did not come to her that night
or the next day, as had been promised, and the day following she went
to the house to learn if anything serious had happened. Laieikawai and
her husband were sleeping soundly. Waka was enraged, for the man was
not the one she had selected.</p>
<p>Waking her granddaughter and pointing to the man, she exclaimed,
&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kekalukaluokewa,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Waka; &ldquo;this is Halaaniani, the
brother of Malio!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angered at the deception, Waka declared that she would deprive
Laieikawai of her powers and privileges, and desired never to behold
her face again.</p>
<p>Abandoning Laieikawai, Waka resolved to assume the charge of her
twin-sister, Laielohelohe, and wed her to the king of Kauai. She had
been left, it will be remembered, with the priest of Kukaniloko, on the
island of Oahu. To this end Waka had a new house erected, and,
borrowing a double canoe from Kekalukaluokewa, sailed at once for
Oahu.</p>
<p>Arriving at Kukaniloko, she offered a pig as a propitiation, and
explained her errand to Kapukaihaoa, who approved her plans and
delivered Laielohelohe into her charge.</p>
<p>After an absence of thirty-three days Waka returned to Keaau with
the sister of Laieikawai. At her command the fog gathered, and they
were secretly borne by birds to their new <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb472" href="#pb472" name="pb472">472</a>]</span>house at Paliuli.
Within three days she had a consultation with Kekalukaluokewa in
relation to his marriage with Laielohelohe. She directed him to build a
large <i>kilu</i> shed, and there assemble the people of the district,
that the ceremony might be celebrated with becoming pomp.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Halaaniani had seen Laielohelohe, and determined to
secure her for himself. With this object he persuaded Laieikawai to go
down to Keaau with him for a few days of sea-bathing, leaving her
faithful attendants behind. Arriving there, he told her that he was
about to visit his sister, Malio, and if he did not return in two days
she might consider him dead.</p>
<p>On the twelfth day the five sisters went down to Keaau and joined
their mistress in wailing over her husband, whom she believed to be
dead. Soon after they all had dreams of Halaaniani with another woman,
and concluded to cease their mourning and return to Paliuli.</p>
<p>Halaaniani visited his sister and induced her to assist him in his
designs concerning Laielohelohe. She advised him to watch her for four
days, and report his observations. He did so, and reported that her
chief occupation was stringing <i>lehua</i> flowers; and he climbed a
tree to observe her, while his sister sounded the <i>pulai</i>, or
<i>ti</i>-leaf trumpet, five times, and again five times; but
Laielohelohe did not take the slightest notice of it.</p>
<p>The next morning they went there again, and he climbed a tree with a
mass of <i>lehua</i> blossoms, and threw them down before her, while
his sister played the <i>hano</i>, a sweet-toned wind instrument. This
attracted the attention of Laielohelohe, and, without seeing the
musician, she expressed her thanks.</p>
<p>The morning following they repeated these man&oelig;uvres three
times. Then Laielohelohe spoke and said: &ldquo;If the musician is a
woman, let us touch noses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this Malio showed herself, and proposed that she should touch
noses with her brother first. This angered her, and she ordered both of
them to leave.</p>
<p>Malio admitted her failure, but promised to resort to supernatural
agencies, and win Laielohelohe for her brother on her wedding-day, as
had been done with Laieikawai.</p>
<p>About this time Waka went down to communicate to Kekalukaluokewa her
programme for the marriage ceremonies, fixed for the day following. He
was to order the people and his court to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb473" href="#pb473" name="pb473">473</a>]</span>assemble at the
appointed place, and at noon was to retire to his own house. She would
then cover the land with a thick mist, and the singing of birds would
be heard; first the quack of the <i>alae</i> and the chirruping of
<i>ewaewaiki</i>, on hearing which he would step without the house.
Next he would hear the singing of the <i>oo</i>, which would indicate
that she was about to send to him Laielohelohe. Then would be heard the
notes of the <i>iiwipolena</i>, and his bride would be near him.
Lastly, he would hear the singing of the <i>ka&rsquo;huli</i>, and they
would meet apart from the assemblage, when thunder would peal, the
earth would quake, and the people would tremble. Then the two would be
borne upward by birds, the mist would clear away, and they would be
seen resting upon the birds in glory.</p>
<p>Laieikawai and the five sisters were anxious to witness the coming
display, of which they had heard, and Kahalaomapuana engaged the
<i>moo</i> god, Kihanuilulumoku, to convey them thither at the
appointed time.</p>
<p>Malio assured her brother again that her power would prevail over
the efforts of Waka, and the preliminaries of the ceremony began. At
noon Kekalukaluokewa, dressed as became the occasion, entered his
house, as had been arranged. He heard the singing of birds, came forth
in the fog, and awaited the coming of his bride. A clap of thunder
followed, when the fog lifted, and Laielohelohe and Halaaniani were
seen rising in the air on the wings of birds. Laieikawai and her
attendants witnessed the ascension, sitting on the tongue of the great
<i>moo</i>.</p>
<p>Believing that he had again lost his bride, Kekalukaluokewa sought
Waka, to chide her for the failure. &ldquo;She is not his yet,&rdquo;
said Waka, &ldquo;for she has obeyed my command not to speak to or
touch noses with him&rdquo;; and, to reassure the king, she offered to
stake her life that all would yet be well.</p>
<p>As they approached the place of assembly Waka again enveloped it in
fog, and immediately sent Kekalukaluokewa upward in the air on the
wings of birds. When the fog cleared away, Kekalukaluokewa and
Laielohelohe were beheld sitting together, upborne by birds, and the
multitude shouted, &ldquo;<i lang="haw">Hoao na &rsquo;lii!
e!</i><span class="corr" id="xd26e13016" title=
"Source: &rsquo;">&rdquo;</span> (&ldquo;the chiefs are
married!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>When Waka heard these acclamations she appeared before the
congregation and denounced Laieikawai in the most opprobrious terms.
The latter departed in shame and rage, and was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb474" href="#pb474" name=
"pb474">474</a>]</span>carried by the <i>moo</i>, together with the
five sisters, to Olaa, where she took up her residence.</p>
<p>Halaaniani&rsquo;s misdemeanors finally brought him into great
contempt, and he was despised and condemned by all. The Kauai king
returned home with his bride, taking with him Waka. On their way they
stopped at Oahu to take on board the priest Kapukaihaoa, who became the
prime minister of Kauai.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The sisters of Aiwohikupua, chagrined at what had
befallen their mistress, resolved to send Kahalaomapuana to
Kealohilani, in a far-distant land, to bring their brother,
Kaonohiokala, to marry Laieikawai, in order that she might triumph over
Waka.</p>
<p>Accordingly, she started on her voyage, being carried by the
gigantic <i lang="haw">moo</i> god, Kihanuilulumoku. Meantime,
Laieikawai and her train made a pleasure trip around Hawaii, first to
Kau, then to Kona, and next to Kohala.</p>
<p>Becoming discouraged, the old prophet of Kauai had left
Kaiwilahilahi, Hawaii, and started for his native island. Touching at
Waimea, he saw the well-known rainbow over Kaiopae, a half-hour&rsquo;s
journey north of Kawaihae, and followed it to Moolau, and then to
Puakea, in Kohala, where he finally met and conversed with
Laieikawai.</p>
<p>He procured a double canoe for the party, and they sailed together
to Laie, Oahu, where he learned the history of Laieikawai. That night
his guardian deity informed him in a dream that she was the person he
had been seeking for so long, and directed him to take the party to
Haena, Kauai. In the morning he offered a pig and fowl before her, and
obtained her consent for him to become her guardian. They then sailed
for Kauai, and settled at Honopuwaiakua.</p>
<p>In one of his subsequent tours the prophet found, on arriving at
Wailua, that all the virgin daughters of the petty chiefs and courtiers
on Kauai had been collected there, in order that Aiwohikupua might
select two new wives to take the places of Poliahu and
Hinaikamalama.</p>
<p>The prophet spoke so contemptuously of the girls brought there for
inspection, and boasted so loudly of the beauty and graces of his
adopted daughter, that a quarrel arose and he was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb475" href="#pb475" name=
"pb475">475</a>]</span>thrown into prison. He escaped during the night,
however, and it was reported to the chief that he was dead. He had left
a banana trunk wrapped in cloth, and it was offered on the altar of the
<i lang="haw">heiau</i> in the place of his body.</p>
<p>At the moment when the deception was discovered the prophet made his
appearance on the platform of a double canoe at the mouth of the river,
with Laieikawai and the five sisters on board<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e13053" title="Not in source">.</span> Then Laieikawai stepped
upon the platform, surrounded with the insignia of a <i lang=
"haw">tabu</i> chief, and the winds ceased, the sea rose, thunders
reverberated, lightnings flashed, and the <i lang="haw">heiau</i> and
altar were shaken almost to ruins.</p>
<p>The assembled multitude shouted in admiration of the beauty of
Laieikawai, and Aiwohikupua, after recovering from the shock of what he
had witnessed, sent a herald to demand her in marriage. But the prophet
proudly answered that she was not for such as he, and would marry no
one of lower rank than the sovereign of an island. They then returned
to Honopuwaiakua.</p>
<p>We will now return to Kahalaomapuana, who was sent to a far-distant
land in search of her brother, in the hope of making him the husband of
Laieikawai. For four months the great <i lang="haw">moo</i> swam with
her in his mouth, and they arrived at last at Kealohilani. But the
guardian of the place was absent on a visit to the Moon, and they
awaited his return for twenty days.</p>
<p>On his arrival he was greatly alarmed at the sight of the gigantic
reptile, lying with his head in the house and his tail in the sea, and
without a word flew to Nuumealani to consult Kaeloikamalama, the
powerful <i lang="haw">kupua</i>, who shut the door of the <i lang=
"haw">pea kapu</i> of the <i lang="haw">Kukulu o Kahiki</i>, where
Kaonohiokala was concealed.</p>
<p>They returned together, the <i lang="haw">kupua</i> armed with a
<i lang="haw">laau palau</i> a hundred paces long with which to slay
the <i lang="haw">moo</i>. Just as he was preparing to strike, the
<i lang="haw">moo</i> stirred his tail in the ocean and sent a
tremendous breaker rolling inland, and they both started to retreat. At
that moment the <i lang="haw">moo</i> cast out Kahalaomapuana on the
neck of her uncle, Kaeloikamalama. He asked her who she was and the
object of her visit, which she explained, and also their relationship.
Then both embraced her affectionately, for they were brothers of her
mother.</p>
<p>In furtherance of the purposes of her visit, Kaeloikamalama took his
niece with him on a ten days&rsquo; journey to the place of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb476" href="#pb476" name=
"pb476">476</a>]</span>ascent, where he called upon Lanalananuiaimakua
to let down the ladder. Before long a sort of spider&rsquo;s web,
branching through the air, descended. He then gave his niece full
directions, as follows: &ldquo;Here is your way to ascend until you see
a single house standing in the Moon, in the land of Kahakaekaea, where
dwells Moanalihaikawaokele, your father, an old man with long hair and
bent head. If he is awake do not approach him, lest he see you first,
and you die before you have a chance to speak. Wait until he is asleep
on his back; then cautiously approach from the leeward, spring on his
breast, grasp him tightly by the beard, and chant the <i>mele</i> in
which I will instruct you.&rdquo; Instructing her in the <i>mele</i>,
he continued: &ldquo;Explain to him the object of your visit, and all
will be well.&rdquo; She was about to begin the ascent when he imparted
this final information: &ldquo;In ascending, if fine rain falls and you
are chilly, fear not; it is caused by your father. Climb on, and,
should you smell fragrance, know that it is caused by your mother and
that you are approaching the end of your journey. If the sunbeams
pierce you and the heat beats upon your head, do not fear. Persevere,
and you will enter the shelter of the Moon and be safe in
Kahakaekaea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these instructions she boldly began the ascent. Climbing upward
without ceasing, toward evening she encountered fine rain and mist;
early next morning she smelt the fragrance of the shrub <i>kiele</i>;
at midday she suffered from the heat of the sun, and in the evening
entered the cool shade of the Moon, in the land of Kahakaekaea.</p>
<p>Observing a large house standing alone, she proceeded to the lee
side, and waited until the old man fell asleep on his back. She then
grasped his beard and chanted the <i>mele</i>, as instructed by her
uncle. He awoke, but she held him where lay his strength, and his
struggles were vain. He asked her who she was, and about her relatives,
and her answers were satisfactory. She then let go his beard and he
took her on his knee and wailed over her.</p>
<p>He then inquired the object of her visit, and she related the whole
story. He informed her that it was not within his power to grant her
request, and that she must apply to her mother, who lived with her son,
Kaonohiokala, in a sacred, inaccessible place, and only visited
Kahakaekaea once every month. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb477"
href="#pb477" name="pb477">477</a>]</span></p>
<p>By stratagem she obtained an interview with her mother, Laukieleula,
and after great persuasion secured her assistance in advancing the
purposes of her visit. The old woman then summoned the bird-god,
Haluluikekihiokamalama, to take them up into the <i>pea kapu</i> of the
<i>Kukulu o Kahiki</i>. The bird reached down a wing, upon which they
both mounted and were carried to Awakea (noon), the god who opens the
gate of the Sun, where dwelt Kaonohiokala (the eye-ball of the
sun).</p>
<p>They found the place shut in by thunder-clouds. They called upon
Awakea, who rose with intense heat and dispersed the clouds, disclosing
to their view the prince asleep in the very centre of the Sun, where
the air was white with heat. He awoke. His eyes were like lightning,
and his body gleamed like molten lava.</p>
<p>Laukieleula called to him and said: &ldquo;Your favorite sister is
here.&rdquo; He looked up, and then summoned the guardians of the shade
to appear and stand before him. This they promptly did, and the heat of
the sun was mitigated. His resting-place being thus shaded, he called
his sister to him and wailed over her, for they had been separated for
a long time. He inquired the object of her visit, and about their
sisters, and brother Aiwohikupua, and was interested in all that
related to them.</p>
<p>Through the advice of his mother he consented to descend and marry
Laieikawai, and the signs of his coming, he explained, would be as
follows: First, there would be a heavy rain and high surf before he
started. Next, there would be strong wind for ten days, followed by
thunder without rain; then he would be in Kahakaekaea. When it
thundered again twice he would be at Nuumealani, and when it thundered
thrice he would be in Kealohilani. There he would lay aside his
<i>tabu</i> supernatural form and assume the human shape as a high
chief. After this there would be many portents, such as thunder,
lightning, rain, fog, rainbows, high seas and mist on the ocean, and in
one month thereafter he would appear on the mountain ridge at dawn.
When the sun rose a halo would surround him, and in the evening, when
the full moon rose in the night of <i>Mahealani</i>, he would appear
and marry Laieikawai. After this he would punish the enemies of his
sisters and his bride. As a token he gave to his sister for Laieikawai
a rainbow-robe.</p>
<p>Kahalaomapuana was a month in returning to Kealohilani, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb478" href="#pb478" name=
"pb478">478</a>]</span>where she found the <i>moo</i> in waiting for
her. He swam with her across the great waters to Hawaii, but, not
finding their friends at Olaa, he hunted all through the islands, like
a dog scenting for his master, until he found them at Honopuwaiakua,
Kauai. The whole trip occupied eleven months and fourteen days.</p>
<p>Kahalaomapuana gave her friends a full history of her extraordinary
journey, to the dismay of Laieikawai, who was awed at the thought of
her intended husband. The prophet, who knew nothing of the mission of
the sister until her return, had predicted the coming of Kaonohiokala a
month before; and now he traveled around the island warning the people,
and advising Aiwohikupua, in particular, to set up <i>tabu</i> flags
all around his place and collect his family within the precinct; but he
was repelled with insult. He gave the same advice to Kekalukaluokewa,
who obeyed it in spite of the opposition of Waka.</p>
<p>Ten days after the return of Kahalaomapuana the portents began to
appear in the order already named, and in due time Kaonohiokala
appeared, surrounded by a halo. Shouts of acclamation and homage were
heard throughout the island, and Laieikawai put on her rainbow
robe.</p>
<p>In the evening, as the full moon rose, the prince descended from the
mountain and came within the circle of the prophet, and they all
prostrated themselves before him. He spoke graciously to them, and told
Laieikawai that he had come to make good the promise made to her
through his sister. Then all shouted, &ldquo;<i lang="haw">Amana! ua
noa, lele wale aku la!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rainbow appeared, and on it the prince and his bride were suddenly
drawn upward to the moon. A few nights after, as the moon was directly
overhead, a rainbow was let down like a ladder, on which they
descended. Summoning the prophet, the prince directed him to travel
around the island and make proclamation for all to assemble at the end
of ten days at Pihanakalani. The five sisters, and afterwards the
prophet, were taken up to dwell in the coolness of the moon.</p>
<p>One morning the assemblage at Pihanakalani saw the rainbow again let
down from the moon, and standing upon it were the prince and his bride,
the five sisters and the prophet.</p>
<p>Vengeance was executed upon Waka, who was killed by a thunderbolt,
and upon Aiwohikupua, who was reduced to poverty and contempt.
Laielohelohe and Kekalukaluokewa were retained <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb479" href="#pb479" name="pb479">479</a>]</span>in
favor under Kahalaomapuana, who was designated as the regent of her
brother, and the four other sisters were made the governesses of the
rest of the islands of the group.</p>
<p>The affairs of state being thus summarily settled, Kaonohiokala
again departed with his bride up the rainbow beyond the clouds, to
dwell in the <i>pea kapu o Kukulu o Kahiki</i>, above the land called
Kahakaekaea.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Kaonohiokala made quarterly visits to his earthly
dominions, to see that all went well with their rulers. Laielohelohe
had grown more beautiful than her sister, and he became enamored of
her.</p>
<p>To promote his designs he made Kahalaomapuana joint regent with
Mokukelekahiki in Kealohilani, and appointed Kekalukaluokewa to the
regency of the entire group. He then requested the regent to make a
tour of the islands, leaving Laielohelohe at Pihanakalani. He next
applied to her guardian, Kapukaihaoa, and gained his consent to aid in
her seduction.</p>
<p>After Kaonohiokala had made two more trips to earth in furtherance
of this intrigue, Laielohelohe resolved to seek her husband, and set
sail, accordingly, for the windward islands. She found him at
Honokalani, Maui, engaged in an amour with Hinaikamalama, the Hana
chiefess who had abandoned Aiwohikupua. After unavailing efforts to
reclaim him she returned to Kauai.</p>
<p>Kaonohiokala then renewed his visits, and at last remained a year
with the deserted wife. The forsaken Laieikawai appealed to her
father-in-law, who directed her to go to the <i lang="haw">tabu
heiau</i> when old Laukieleula was asleep, and consult the bowl of
knowledge. It was a wooden bowl, covered with wicker-work, the edge of
the lid being decorated with feathers, and with carved images of birds
standing on the rim. She was to remove the lid, insert her face in the
bowl, and call &ldquo;Laukapalili!&rdquo; to give her the knowledge she
required.</p>
<p>She followed these directions and saw what her husband was doing on
earth. His father and mother also looked, and observed for themselves
the treachery of their son. Straightway the ladder was let down to the
presence of Kaonohiokala. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb480"
href="#pb480" name="pb480">480</a>]</span>sky was darkened and filled
with uncanny forms, and ghastly voices wailed through the air,
&ldquo;<i lang="haw">Ua haule ka lani!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the
heaven has fallen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the three were seen standing together upon the rainbow ladder,
and Moanalihaikawaokele proceeded to pronounce judgment on
Kaonohiokala. He was never to return to the upper world, and was doomed
to become a <i>lapu</i>&mdash;a spectre or wandering ghost&mdash;and
live on butterflies.</p>
<p>Kahalaomapuana took his place in the sun. Laieikawai, at her earnest
request, was restored to earth to live with her sister, and the
government of the group was entrusted to the prophet.</p>
<p>Laieikawai had her name changed to <i>Ka wahine o ka
liula</i>&mdash;&ldquo;the lady of the twilight&rdquo;&mdash;under
which title she was worshipped by certain families after her death.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of all the legends of the adventures with mortals of
Pele, the dreadful goddess of the volcanoes, the most weird and
dramatic is the one relating to her love for Lohiau, a prince of the
island of Kauai, whose reign was probably contemporaneous with that of
Kealiiokaloa, of Hawaii, during the early part of the sixteenth
century. The story is not only a characteristic relic of the recklessly
imaginative and highly-colored <i>meles</i> of the early poets, but an
instructive reflex as well of the superstitions controlling the popular
mind of the Hawaiian group at that period, when the forests abounded in
mischievous gnomes and fairies, when the streams were guarded by nymphs
and monsters, and when the very air was peopled with the spirits of the
departed. But a thin veil then divided the living from the dead, the
natural from the supernatural, and mortals were made the sport of the
elements and the playthings of the gods.</p>
<p>As the <i>mele</i> relates, Pele and her brothers and sisters, to
amuse themselves with a taste of mortal enjoyments, one day emerged
from their fiery chambers in the crater of Kilauea, and went down to
the coast of Puna to bathe, surf-ride, sport in the sands, and gather
edible sea-weed, squid, limpets and other delicacies washed by the
waves. They assumed human forms for the occasion, and therefore had
human appetites.</p>
<p>While the others were amusing themselves in various
ways&mdash;eating, laughing and sporting in the waves in the manner of
mortals&mdash;Pele, in the guise of an old woman, sought repose and
sleep in the shade of a <i>hala</i> tree. Her favorite sister was
Hiiaka, her full name being Hiiaka-ika-pali-opele. She was younger than
Pele, and frequently occupied the same grotto with her under the
burning lake of Kilauea. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb484" href=
"#pb484" name="pb484">484</a>]</span></p>
<p>Hiiaka accompanied her sovereign sister to the shade of the
<i>hala</i> tree, and, sitting devotedly beside her, kept her cool with
a <i>kahili</i>. Her eyelids growing heavy, Pele instructed Hiiaka to
allow her under no circumstances to be disturbed, no matter how long
she might sleep, whether for hours or days, and then closed her eyes in
slumber.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the ears of the sleeper been closed by the fingers of
silence before she heard the sound of a drum&mdash;distant, but
distinct and regular in its beat, as if to the impulse of music. Before
leaving the crater she had heard the same sound, but paid little
attention to it. Now, however, when hearing it in her dreams, her
curiosity was aroused, and, assuming her spiritual form, she resolved
to follow it.</p>
<p>Leaving her slumbering earthly body under the eye and care of her
sister, Pele mounted the air and proceeded in the direction whence the
sound seemed to come. From place to place she followed it over the
island of Hawaii; but it was always before her, and she could not
overtake it. At Upolu it came to her from over the sea, and she
followed it to the island of Maui. It was still beyond, and she sped to
Molokai; still beyond, and she flew to Oahu; still beyond, and she
crossed the channel and listened on the shores of Kauai, where it was
more distinct than she had heard it before. Now encouraged, she
continued the pursuit until she stood upon the mountain peak of Haupu,
when she discovered at last that the sound came from the beach at
Kaena.</p>
<p>Proceeding thither, and hovering over the place unseen, she observed
that the sound she had so long been following was that of a
<i>pahu-hula</i>, or <i>hula</i> drum, beaten by Lohiau, the young and
comely prince of Kauai, who was noted not only for the splendor of his
<i>hula</i> entertainments, participated in by the most beautiful women
of the island, but for his personal graces as a dancer and musician.
The favorite deity of Lohiau was <i>Lakakane</i>, the god of the
<i>hula</i> and similar sports, who in a spirit of mischief had
conveyed the sound of the drum to the ears of Pele.</p>
<p>The beach was thronged with dancers, musicians and spectators, all
enjoying themselves under the shade of the <i>hala</i> and cocoa trees,
with the prince as master of ceremonies and the centre of attraction.
Assuming the form of a beautiful woman, Pele suddenly appeared before
the festive throng. Attaching to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb485"
href="#pb485" name="pb485">485</a>]</span>her person every imaginable
charm of form and feature, her presence was immediately noted; and, a
way being opened for her to the prince, he received her most graciously
and invited her to a seat near him, where she could best witness the
entertainment.</p>
<p>Glancing at the beautiful stranger from time to time in the midst of
his performances, Lohiau at length became so fascinated that he failed
to follow the music, when he yielded the instrument to another and
seated himself beside the enchantress. In answer to his inquiry she
informed the prince that she was a stranger in Kauai, and had come from
the direction of the rising sun. Gazing into her face with a devouring
passion, Lohiau smilingly said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are most welcome, but I cannot rejoice that you
came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why, since I do not come as your enemy?&rdquo; inquired
Pele, archly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, until now,&rdquo; returned the prince, &ldquo;my
thought has been that there were beautiful women in Kauai; but in
looking at yours I find their faces are plain indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you know how to speak flattering words to women,&rdquo;
said Pele, casting a languishing look upon the prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not better than I know how to love them,&rdquo; replied
Lohiau, with ardor. &ldquo;Will you be convinced?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lohiau is in his own kingdom, and has but to command,&rdquo;
answered Pele, with a play of modesty which completed the enthralment
of the prince.</p>
<p>Thus Pele became the wife of Lohiau. He knew nothing of her or her
family, and cared not to inquire. He saw only that she was beautiful
above all women, and for a few days they lived so happily together that
life seemed to be a dream to him. And Pele loved the prince scarcely
less than he loved her; but the time had come for her return to Hawaii,
and, pledging him to remain true to her, she left him with
protestations of affection and the promise of a speedy return, and on
the wings of the wind was wafted back to the shores of Puna, where she
had left her sister waiting and watching in the shade of the
<i>hala</i>.</p>
<p>Lohiau was inconsolable. Every day he thought she would be with him
the next, until more than a month passed, when he refused food and died
of grief at her absence. The strange death of the prince occasioned
much comment, for he was naturally <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb486"
href="#pb486" name="pb486">486</a>]</span>strong and without disease.
Some said he had been prayed to death by his enemies, and others that
he had been poisoned; but an old <i>kaula</i>, who had seen Pele at
Kaena and noted her actions, advised against further inquiry concerning
the cause of Lohiau&rsquo;s death, offering as a reason the opinion
that the strangely beautiful and unknown woman he had taken as a wife
was an immortal, who had become attached to her earthly husband and
called his spirit to her.</p>
<p>The prince was greatly beloved by his people, and his body,
carefully wrapped in many folds of <i>kapa</i>, was kept in state for
some time in the royal mansion. It was guarded by the high chiefs of
the kingdom, and every night funeral hymns were chanted around it, and
<i>meles</i> recited of the deeds of the dead sovereign and his
ancestors. Thus lying in state we will leave the remains of Lohiau, and
follow Pele back to Hawaii.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During all the time the spirit of Pele was absent the
family kept watch over the body left by her under the <i>hala</i> tree,
not daring to disturb it, and were overjoyed when it was at last
reanimated, for the fires of the crater of Kilauea had nearly died out
from neglect. Pele rose to her feet in the form of the old woman she
had left asleep under the care of Hiiaka, and, without at the time
mentioning her adventures in Kauai or the cause of her protracted
slumber, returned with all but one of the family to Kilauea, and with a
breath renewed the dying fires of the crater. Hiiaka asked and received
the permission of Pele to remain for a few days at the beach with her
much-loved friend Hopoe, a young woman of Puna, who had been left an
orphan by an irruption from Kilauea, in which both of her parents had
perished.</p>
<p>On leaving Kauai it is probable that Pele, notwithstanding her
fervent words to the contrary, never expected or particularly desired
to see Lohiau again; but he had so endeared himself to her during their
brief union that she did not find it easy to forget him, and, after
struggling with the feeling for some time, she resolved to send for
him. But to whom should she entrust the important mission? One after
another she applied to her sisters at the crater, but the way was beset
with evil spirits, and they refused to go.</p>
<p>In this dilemma Pele sent her favorite brother, Lonoikaonolii,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb487" href="#pb487" name=
"pb487">487</a>]</span>to bring Hiiaka from the beach, well knowing
that she would not refuse to undertake the journey, however hazardous.
Hiiaka accepted the mission, with the understanding that during her
absence her friend Hopoe should be kept under the eye and guardianship
of Pele.</p>
<p>Arrangements were made for the immediate departure of Hiiaka. Pele
conferred upon her some of her own powers, with an injunction to use
them discreetly, and for a companion and servant gave her Pauo-palae, a
woman of approved sagacity and prudence.</p>
<p>With a farewell from her relatives and many an admonition from Pele,
Hiiaka took her departure for Kauai, accompanied by Pauo-palae. They
traveled as mortals, and were therefore subject to the fatigues and
perils of humanity. Proceeding through the forests toward the coast of
Hilo, they encountered an old woman, who accosted them politely and
expressed a desire to follow them. Her name was Omeo, and she was
leading a hog to the volcano as a sacrifice to Pele. No objection being
made, she hurried to the crater with her offering, and returned and
followed Hiiaka and her companion.</p>
<p>Not long after, their journey was impeded by a demon of hideous
proportions, who threw himself across their path in a narrow defile and
attempted to destroy them. Pele knew their danger, however, and ordered
her brothers to protect them with a rain of fire and thunder, which
drove the monster to his den in the hills and enabled them to
escape.</p>
<p>After a little time they were joined by another woman, whose name
was Papau. She desired to accompany them, and proceeded a short
distance on the way, when they were confronted by a ferocious-looking
man who was either insane or under the influence of evil spirits. He
lacked either the power or the disposition to molest the party,
however, and they passed on unharmed; but Papau screamed with fright
and hastily returned to her home, where she was turned into a stone as
a punishment for her cowardice.</p>
<p>Coming to a small stream crossed by their path, they found the
waters dammed by a huge <i>moo</i>, or lizard, lying in the bed. He was
more than a hundred paces in length, and his eyes were of the size of
great calabashes. He glared at the party viciously and opened his mouth
as if to devour them; but Hiiaka tossed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb488" href="#pb488" name="pb488">488</a>]</span>into it a stone,
which became red-hot when it touched his throat, and, with a roar of
pain which made the leaves of the trees tremble, he disappeared down
the stream.</p>
<p>After many other adventures with monsters and evil spirits, which
Hiiaka was able to control and sometimes punish, the party reached the
coast at a place called Honoipo, where they found a number of men and
women engaged in the sport of surf-riding. As they were about to start
for another trial, in a spirit of mischief Hiiaka turned their
surf-boards into stone, and they fled in terror from the beach, fearing
that some sea-god was preparing to devour them.</p>
<p>Observing a fisherman drawing in his line, Hiiaka caused to be
fastened to the submerged hook a human head. Raising it to the surface,
the man stared at it for a moment with horror, then dropped the line
and paddled swiftly away, to the great amusement of Hiiaka and her
companions.</p>
<p>Embarking in a canoe with two men as assistants, the travelers
sailed for the island of Maui, which they reached without delay or
accident. Landing at Kaupo, they traveled overland toward Honuaula,
near which place, in approaching the palace of the king, whose name was
Olepau, and who was lying within at the point of death, Hiiaka observed
a human spirit hovering around the outer enclosure. Knowing that it was
the half-freed soul or spirit of the <i>moi</i>, she seized and tied it
up in a corner of her <i>pau</i>.</p>
<p>Passing on with the soul of the king in her keeping, she met the
queen, Waihimano, and told her that her husband had just died. But the
queen denied that Olepau was dead, for she was a worshipper of two
powerful lizard divinities, and the gods had assured her that morning
that her husband would recover.</p>
<p>Saying no more, Hiiaka and her companions went on their way, and the
queen, returning to the palace, found her husband insensible and
apparently dead. Trying in vain to restore him, she hastily consulted a
<i>kaula</i>, telling him what the strange woman had said to her. The
seer by the description recognized at once the sister of Pele, who had
come to heal the king, but had been deterred in her errand of mercy by
the queen&rsquo;s obstinate assurances of his recovery. He therefore
advised that she be followed by a messenger with a spotless pig to be
placed as an offering in the path before her, when she perchance might
return and restore the king to life. But Hiiaka dropped behind her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb489" href="#pb489" name=
"pb489">489</a>]</span>companions and assumed the form of an old woman,
and, as the messenger did not recognize her, he returned with the
report that the object of his search could not be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you meet no one?&rdquo; inquired the seer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one answering the description,&rdquo; replied the
messenger. &ldquo;I saw only an old woman, so infirm as to be scarcely
able to walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; exclaimed the <i>kaula</i>. &ldquo;That old
woman was Hiiaka in disguise. Hasten back to her, if you would save the
life of your king!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The messenger again started in pursuit of Hiiaka, but the pig was
obstinate and troublesome, and his progress was slow. Seizing the
struggling animal in his arms, the messenger ran until he came within
sight of the women, who were again traveling together, when Hiiaka
struck the fold of her <i>pau</i> against a rock, and that instant the
king expired.</p>
<p>Reaching the coast and embarking with a fisherman, Hiiaka and her
companions sailed for Oahu. Landing at Makapuu, they journeyed overland
to Kou&mdash;now Honolulu&mdash;and from Haena made sail for Kauai.
Arriving at Kaena, Hiiaka saw the spirit hand of Lohiau beckoning to
her from the mouth of a cave among the cliffs. Turning to her
companions, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have failed; the lover of Pele is dead! I see his spirit
beckoning from the <i>pali</i>! There it is being held and hidden by
the lizard-women, Kilioa and Kalamainu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instructing her companions to proceed to Puoa, where the body of
Lohiau was lying in state, Hiiaka started at once for the <i>pali</i>,
for the purpose of giving battle to the female demons and rescuing the
spirit of the dead prince.</p>
<p>Ascending the cliff and entering the cave, Hiiaka waved her
<i>pau</i>, and with angry hisses the demons disappeared. Search was
made, and the spirit of Lohiau was found at last in a niche in the
rocks, where it had been placed by a moonbeam. Taking it tenderly in
her hand, she enclosed it in a fold of her <i>pau</i>, and in an
invisible form floated down with it to Puoa.</p>
<p>Waiting until after nightfall, Hiiaka entered the chamber of death
unseen, and restored the spirit to the body of Lohiau. Recovering his
life and consciousness, the prince looked around with amazement. The
guards were frightened when he raised his head, and would have fled in
alarm had they not been prevented <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb490"
href="#pb490" name="pb490">490</a>]</span>by Hiiaka, who at that
instant appeared before them in mortal form. Holding up her hand, as if
to command obedience, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear nothing, say nothing of this to any one living, and do
nothing except as you may be ordered. The prince has returned to life,
and may recover if properly cared for. His body is weak and wasted. Let
him be secretly and at once removed to the sea-shore. The night is
dark, and it may be done without observation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not doubting that these instructions were from the gods, the guards
obeyed them with so much prudence and alacrity that Lohiau was soon
comfortably resting in a hut by the sea-shore, with Hiiaka and her
companions ministering to his wants.</p>
<p>The return of the prince to health and strength was rapid, and in a
few days he reappeared among his friends, to their amazement and great
joy. In answer to their inquiries he informed them that he owed to the
gods his restoration to life. This did not entirely satisfy them, but
no further explanation was offered.</p>
<p>After celebrating his recovery with feasts and sacrifices to the
gods, Lohiau announced to the chiefs of his kingdom that he was about
to visit his wife, whose home was on Hawaii, and that he should leave
the government of the island in the hands of his friend, the high-chief
Paoa, to whom he enjoined the fealty and respect of all during his
absence.</p>
<p>In a magnificent double canoe, bearing the royal standard and
equipped as became the <i>kaulua</i> of an <i>alii-nui</i>, Lohiau set
sail for Hawaii, accompanied by Hiiaka and her companions, and taking
with him his high-priest, chief navigator, and the customary staff of
personal attendants.</p>
<p>Touching at Oahu, Hiiaka ascended the Kaala mountains, and saw that
her beautiful <i>lehua</i> and <i>hala</i> groves near the beach of
Puna, on the distant island of Hawaii, had been destroyed by a lava
flow. Impatient at the long absence of Hiiaka, and jealous as well,
Pele had in a fit of rage destroyed the beautiful sea-shore retreats of
her faithful sister. She scarcely doubted that Hiiaka had dared to love
Lohiau, and in her chambers of fire chafed for her return.</p>
<p>After bewailing her loss Hiiaka rejoined her companions, and Lohiau
embarked for Hawaii. Landing at Kohala, the prince <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb491" href="#pb491" name=
"pb491">491</a>]</span>ordered his attendants to remain there until his
return, and started overland for Kilauea with Hiiaka and her two female
companions. Before reaching the volcano Hiiaka learned something of the
jealous rage of Pele, and finally saw from a distant eminence her dear
friend Hopoe undergoing the cruel tortures of volcanic fire, near the
beach of Puna, which ended in her being turned into stone.</p>
<p>Approaching the crater with apprehensions of further displays of
Pele&rsquo;s fury, Hiiaka sent Omeo and Pauo-palae in advance to
announce to the goddess her return with Lohiau. In her wrath she
ordered both of the women to be slain at once, and resolved to treat
her lover in the same manner.</p>
<p>Aware of this heartless resolution, and unable to avert the
execution of it, on their arrival at the verge of the crater Hiiaka
threw her arms around the neck of the prince, whom she had learned to
love without wrong to her sister, and, telling him of his impending
fate, bade him a tender farewell.</p>
<p>This scene was witnessed by Pele. Enraged beyond measure, she caused
a gulf of molten lava to be opened between Hiiaka and the prince, and
then ordered the instant destruction of Lohiau by fire.</p>
<p>While the sisters of Pele were ascending the walls of the crater to
execute her orders, Lohiau chanted a song to the goddess, avowing his
innocence and pleading for mercy; but her rage was rekindled at the
sound of his voice, and she turned a deaf ear to his entreaties.</p>
<p>Approaching Lohiau, and pitying him, the sisters merely touched the
palms of his hands, which turned them into lava, and then retired.
Observing this, Pele ordered them to return at once, under the penalty
of her displeasure, and consume the body of her lover.</p>
<p>Lohiau again appealed to Pele, so piteously that the trees around
him wept with grief; but her only answer was an impatient signal to her
sisters to resume their work of destruction. In his despair he turned
to Hiiaka and implored her intercession, but she answered in agony that
she could do nothing.</p>
<p>The sisters returned to Lohiau, and reluctantly touched his feet,
which became stone; then his knees; then his thighs; then his breast.
By the power conferred upon her by Pele, and of which she had not yet
been deprived, Hiiaka rendered the body <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb492" href="#pb492" name="pb492">492</a>]</span>of the prince
insensible to pain, and it was therefore without suffering that he felt
his joints hardening into stone under the touch of his sympathizing
executioners.</p>
<p>As the remainder of his body was about to be turned into lava,
Hiiaka said to the prince:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! When you die go to the leeward, and I will find
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment Lohiau was a lifeless pillar of stone.</p>
<p>Observing that the cruel work of her sister had been accomplished,
and that all that remained of the shapely form of Lohiau was a black
mass of lava, Hiiaka caused the earth to be opened at her feet, and
started downward at once for the misty realm of <i>Milu</i> to overtake
the soul of Lohiau, and, with the consent of the god of death, restore
it to its body.</p>
<p>Passing downward through each of the five spheres dividing the
surface of the earth from the regions of <i>Po</i>, where <i>Milu</i>
sits in state in the gloomy groves of death, Hiiaka finally stood in
the presence of the august sovereign of the world of spirits.</p>
<p>The king of death welcomed her to his dominions, and, in response to
her inquiry, informed her that the soul of Lohiau had not yet reached
the abode of spirits. Having no desire to return to earth, Hiiaka
accepted the invitation of <i>Milu</i>, and, watching and waiting for
the soul of Lohiau, remained for a time in the land of spirits.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The attendants of Lohiau remained in Kohala until they
learned of his fate at the hands of Pele, when they returned to Kauai
in the royal <i>kaulua</i>, and horrified the friends of the prince by
relating to them the story of his death.</p>
<p>Enraged and desperate, Paoa, the faithful and sturdy chief to whom
Lohiau had confided the government of his kingdom, started at once for
Hawaii with a small party of retainers, determined, even at the
sacrifice of his life, to denounce the powers that had slain his royal
friend.</p>
<p>Landing on the coast of Puna, he ascended to the crater of Kilauea,
and, standing upon the brink of the seething lake of fire, denounced
the cruelty of Pele and defied her power. He contemptuously threw to
her offerings unfit for sacrifice, and stigmatized <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb493" href="#pb493" name="pb493">493</a>]</span>all
the volcanic deities as evil spirits who had been driven with
<i>Kanaloa</i> from the presence of <i>Kane</i> and the society of the
gods.</p>
<p>Paoa expected to be destroyed at once, and recklessly courted and
awaited death. The brothers and sisters of Pele, with their several
agencies of destruction, were momentarily expecting an order from the
goddess to consume the audacious mortal in his tracks. Never before had
such words of reproach and defiance been uttered by human tongue, and
they could not doubt that swift vengeance would be hurled upon the
offender.</p>
<p>But Pele refused to harm the desperate champion of Lohiau, for
circumstances had convinced her of the innocence of Hiiaka and the
fidelity of the prince. Therefore, instead of punishing the brave Paoa,
Pele and her relatives received him with friendship, gently chided him
for his words of insult and defiance, and disarmed his anger by
forgiving the offence.</p>
<p>Satisfied of the great wrong she had done her faithful sister, and
longing for her presence again in the chambers of the crater, Pele
restored Pauo-palae and Omeo to life, and, endowing the latter with
supernatural powers, sent her down to the regions of the dead to induce
Hiiaka to return to earth.</p>
<p>Descending through the opening made by Hiiaka, Omeo was stopped at
the intervening spheres, owing to the aspects of mortality which she
unconsciously retained, and encountered many difficulties in reaching
the kingdom of <i>Milu</i>. Arriving there and making known the object
of her visit, Omeo was neither assisted nor encouraged in her search
for Hiiaka. <i>Milu</i> was not anxious to part with his distinguished
guest, and attempted to deceive Omeo by intimating that Hiiaka had
returned to earth and was then on a visit to some of the relatives of
her family in Kahiki.</p>
<p>Omeo was about to return, disappointed, to earth, when she
discovered Hiiaka as she was listlessly emerging from a thick grove of
trees where she had spent the most of her time since her arrival there
in quest of the soul of Lohiau. Their greeting was most friendly, and
when Omeo informed her of what had occurred at the volcano since her
departure, she consented to leave the land of death and rejoin her
relatives at the crater.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters of Hiiaka were overjoyed at her return, and
Pele welcomed her with assurances of restored affection. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb494" href="#pb494" name="pb494">494</a>]</span>Paoa
was still there. He was at once recognized by Hiiaka, and the next day
she descended from Kilauea and embarked with him for Kauai in search of
the soul of Lohiau.</p>
<p>The canoe of Paoa had scarcely left the shores of Puna before a
strange craft swept in from the ocean, and was beached at the spot from
which Hiiaka and her companion had embarked less than half a day
before. It was a huge cowrie shell, dazzling in the brilliancy of its
colors, and capable of indefinite expansion. Its masts were of ivory,
and its sails were mats of the whiteness of milk. Both seemed to be
mere ornaments, however, since the shell moved quite as swiftly through
the water without wind as with it.</p>
<p>The sole occupant of the little vessel was the god
<i>Kanemilohai</i>. He was a relative of the Pele family, and came from
Kahiki on a visit to the volcanic deities of Hawaii. Remaining two or
three days with Pele, and learning all that had happened to the family
since they left Kahiki, the god started for Kauai to extend a greeting
to Hiiaka.</p>
<p>Proceeding in a direct route, when about midway between the two
islands the god caught the soul of Lohiau, which had misunderstood the
final directions of Hiiaka and was on its way to Kauai. Not having gone
to the land of spirits, it had been searching everywhere for Hiiaka,
and had at last taken flight for Kauai, when it was intercepted by
<i>Kanemilohai</i>.</p>
<p>The god returned to the crater with the captured spirit, and,
finding the pillar of stone into which Lohiau had been turned, restored
the prince to life. As he recovered his consciousness and opened his
eyes he recognized Pele standing before him. Apprehensive of further
persecution, he was about to appeal to her again for mercy when she
said, in a tone as tender as that in which she had first replied to his
welcome on the beach at Kaena:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear me no longer. I have been unjust to you as well as to
Hiiaka. After what I have done I cannot expect your love. Find Hiiaka
and give it to her. She loves you, and knows how to be kind to a
mortal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lohiau would have thanked the goddess, but when he looked again she
was gone, and in her place stood <i>Kanemilohai</i>, who told him to
take the shell vessel he would find at the beach below, and proceed to
Kauai, where he would probably meet Hiiaka and his friend Paoa.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb495" href="#pb495" name=
"pb495">495</a>]</span></p>
<p>Lohiau hesitated, for there was something in the appearance of
<i>Kanemilohai</i> that inspired a feeling of awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, and fear nothing,&rdquo; said the god, who knew the
thoughts of the prince. &ldquo;The shell was not made in the sea or by
human hands, but it will bear you safely on your journey, no matter how
rough the waves or great its burden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coast of Puna is a day&rsquo;s journey in length,&rdquo;
said Lohiau. &ldquo;Where and how will I be able to find the
shell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasten to the shore at Keauhou,&rdquo; returned the god,
&ldquo;and you will see me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arriving at the beach designated, the prince was surprised to find
<i>Kanemilohai</i> already there; but he found something more to excite
his wonder when the god took from a crevice in the rocks, where it had
been secreted, a shell no larger than the palm of his hand, and passed
it to him with the announcement that it was the barge in which he was
to sail for Kauai.</p>
<p>Lohiau examined the little toy with something of a feeling of
amusement, but more of perplexity, and was about to return it to his
strange companion, when the latter instructed him to place the shell in
the edge of the waters. The prince obeyed, and instantly found before
him the beautiful craft in which the god had made his journey from
Kahiki.</p>
<p>The power being conferred upon him by the god to contract or extend
the proportions of the shell at his will, Lohiau entered the enchanted
vessel of pink and pearl, and, directing its course by simply pointing
his finger, was swiftly borne out into the ocean.</p>
<p>Rounding the southern cape of Hawaii, Lohiau thought of proceeding
directly to Kauai; but he pointed too far to the northward, and the
next morning sighted Oahu. Passing the headland of Leahi, he turned and
entered the harbor of Hou. Landing, he contracted to the dimensions of
a limpet, and secreted in a niche in the rocks, his obedient barge, and
then proceeded to the village, where, he learned to his great joy,
Hiiaka and Paoa were tarrying on a visit. Hou was at that time the
scene of great merriment and feasting. It had become the temporary
residence of the <i>alii-nui</i>, and high-chiefs, <i>kahunas</i>,
adventurers, and noted surf-riders and <i>hula</i> performers had
congregated there from all parts of the island.</p>
<p>Ascertaining that an entertainment of great magnificence was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb496" href="#pb496" name=
"pb496">496</a>]</span>to be given that evening by a distinguished
chiefess in honor of Hiiaka and her companion, Lohiau resolved to be
present. Had he made himself known he would have been entitled to the
consideration of the highest&mdash;would have been, indeed, the guest
of the <i>alii-nui</i>, with the right of entrance anywhere; but fancy
prompted him to hide his rank and appear in disguise among the
revelers.</p>
<p>Early in the evening the grounds of the chiefess were lighted with
hundreds of torches, and under a broad pavilion, festooned and scented
with fragrant vines and flowers, the favored guests, enwreathed and
crowned with leaf and blossom, partook without stint of such delicacies
as the land and sea produced. After the feast, song and music filled
the air, and bands of gaily-decked dancers kept step among the flaring
torches, while around the doors of the mansion white-bearded bards
chanted wild legends of the past and sang the <i>mele-inoas</i> of the
hostess and her distinguished guests.</p>
<p>In the midst of this inspiring revelry the guests divided into
groups as their several tastes suggested. Some strolled out among the
dancers, others listened to the stories of the bards, and one party,
including Hiiaka, Paoa and the hostess, entered the mansion to engage
in the game of <i>kilu</i>. It was a pastime of which singing or
chanting was a part, and the chiefess was noted for her proficiency in
the popular amusement.</p>
<p>Lohiau entered the grounds at the close of the feast, and stood
watching the festivities when the party of <i>kilu</i> players retired
to the mansion. He had turned inward the feathers of his mantle of
royal yellow, and, with his long hair falling over his face and
shoulders, was readily mistaken for a <i>kahuna</i>.</p>
<p>Quite a number of persons thronged around the <i>kilu</i> players to
witness the game, and Lohiau entered the room without hindrance.
Approaching the players, he screened himself behind the <i>kapas</i> of
two old chiefs who were so intently regarding the performance that they
did not observe him.</p>
<p>The game progressed until the <i>kilu</i> fell to Hiiaka, and as she
threw it she chanted a song of her own composing, in which the name of
Lohiau was mentioned with tenderness. The song ceased, and from behind
the spectators came the answering voice of the prince. As he sang he
brushed back the hair from his handsome face and turned outward the
yellow feathers of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb497" href=
"#pb497" name="pb497">497</a>]</span>mantle. The throng divided, the
singer advanced, and before the players stood Lohiau, the prince of
Kauai.</p>
<p>He was recognized at once. Hiiaka threw herself into his arms, and
the faithful Paoa wept with joy. Informed of the rank of the
distinguished visitor, the guests vied with each other in showing him
honor, and the festivities were renewed and carried far into the
night.</p>
<p>Learning the next day of the presence near his court of the
sovereign of Kauai, the <i>alii-nui</i> would have entertained him in a
manner befitting the high rank of both; but Lohiau was anxious to
return to his people, and set sail for Kauai at once in the shell barge
of <i>Kanemilohai</i>, expanded to adequate dimensions, taking with him
Hiiaka and Paoa.</p>
<p>Although Hiiaka soon after returned to Hawaii and effected a
complete reconciliation with her sister, while Lohiau lived she spent
much of her time in Kauai. Hopoe was restored to life, and Omeo, or
Wahineomeo, was given an immortal form for what she had done, and
became thereafter the mediator between the volcanic deities.

<p class="h2main">KAHAVARI, CHIEF OF PUNA.</p>
<p class="h2sub">A STORY OF THE VENGEANCE OF THE GODDESS PELE.</p>
<p>Between Cape Kumakahi, the extreme eastern point of the island of
Hawaii, and the great lava flow of 1840, which burst forth apparently
from a long subterranean channel connecting with the crater of Kilauea,
and went down to the sea at Nanawale over villages and groves of palms,
is a small historic district which, notwithstanding the repeated
volcanic disturbances with which it has been convulsed in the past, the
chasms with which it has been rent, and the smoke and ashes that have
shut out the light of the sun and driven its people to the protection
of their temples, still possesses many fertile nooks and natural
attractions. Within a few miles of each other, not far inland, are a
number of extinct craters; but the rains are abundant in Puna, and
spring is eternal, and the vegetation grows rank above hidden patches
of lava, and is constantly stretching and deepening its mantle of green
over the vitreous rivers of Kilauea and the lower and lesser volcanic
vents clinging to its base like so many cauterized ulcers.</p>
<p>The valleys are green in that part of Puna now, and there the banana
and the bread-fruit grow, and the <i>ohia</i> and pineapple scent the
air. But so has it not always been, for the mango ripens over fields of
buried lava, and the palms grow tall from the refilled chasms of dead
streams of fire. The depression of Kapoho, now sweet with tropical
odors, marks the site of a sunken mountain, and where to-day sleep the
quiet waters of a lake once boiled a sea of liquid lava, in a basin
broader, perhaps, than the mighty caldron of Kilauea.</p>
<p>We are now about to speak of one of the many irruptions which at
intervals in the past poured their desolating torrents of fire through
the district, alternately loved and hated by Pele, the dreadful goddess
of the volcanoes. In connection with it tradition <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb502" href="#pb502" name="pb502">502</a>]</span>has
brought down a tale combining elements of simplicity and grandeur
strikingly characteristic of the mythological legends of
Polynesia&mdash;legends equaling the Norse in audacity, but lacking the
motive and connecting causes of the Greek. They are simply legendary
epics, beginning in caprice and abruptly ending, in many instances, in
grandest tumult. They are like chapters torn from a lost
volume&mdash;patches of disturbed elements and gigantic forms and
energies clandestinely cut from a passing panorama and placed in the
foreground of strange and inharmonious conditions. They embrace gods
reminding us of Thor, monsters more hideous than Polyphemus, demi-gods
mighty as the son of Thetis, and kings with strains reaching back to
the loins of gods; but in motive and action they were independent of,
and not unfrequently hostile to, each other. No celestial synod shaped
their course or moved them to effort, and to no authority higher than
their individual wills were they usually responsible. Many of them were
created with no reference to the necessity of their being or the
maintenance of divine respect or authority, and not a few seem to have
been the creations of accident.</p>
<p>As an example the demi-god <i>Maui</i> may be mentioned. As told by
tradition, his principal abode was Hawaii, although his facilities for
visiting the other islands of the group will be considered ample when
it is stated that he could step from one to another, even from Oahu to
Kauai, a distance of seventy miles. When he bathed&mdash;and bathing
was one of his greatest delights&mdash;his feet trod the deepest basins
of the ocean and his hair was moistened with the vapor of the clouds.
Neither his creator nor the purpose of his creation is mentioned; but
he was blest with a wife with proportions, it is presumed, somewhat in
keeping with his own, and as an evidence of their attachment it is
related that at one time he reached up and seized the sun, and held it
for some hours motionless in the heavens, to enable his industrious
spouse to complete the manufacture of a piece of <i>kapa</i> upon which
she was engaged.</p>
<p>And <i>Kana</i> was another gigantic being of similar proportions.
He, too, was partial to Hawaii, and could step from island to island,
and frequently stood for his amusement with one foot on Oahu and the
other either on Maui or Kauai. Tradition may have confounded these two
monsters; but, as <i>Kana</i> was wifeless, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb503" href="#pb503" name="pb503">503</a>]</span>we
are constrained to regard them as distinct; and, being without the care
of a wife, he was enabled to devote his entire attention to himself and
the inhabitants of the islands crawling at his feet. Hence, when the
king of Kahiki, who was the keeper of the sun, shut its light from the
Hawaiians for some trivial offence, <i>Kana</i> waded the ocean to the
home of the vindictive monarch, and by threats compelled him to restore
the light to the Hawaiian group. This done, he waded back and hung his
mantle to dry on Mauna Kea, which was then an active volcano. Another
demi-god of the same name is also referred to in some of the early
<i>meles</i> of Hawaii. He was the son of Hina, who went with his
brother to the rescue of their mother, who had been during their
infancy abducted by the son of the king of Molokai. He was endowed by
his grandmother, a sorceress from one of the southern islands, with the
faculty of so elongating and contracting his person as to be able to
pass through the deepest waters with his head at all times above the
surface.</p>
<p>The shadows of these and other monsters are seen far back in the
past; but human beings of gigantic proportions, of natural birth and
claiming no connection with the gods, are mentioned in Hawaiian
folk-lore as having lived as late as the beginning of the sixteenth
century. Thus, during the reign of Umi, king of Hawaii, whose romantic
ascent to the throne is the theme of chant and song, and to whom the
past and present dynasties of united Hawaii trace their descent, lived
the giant Maukaleoleo. He was one of Umi&rsquo;s warriors, and must
have been a mighty host in himself. His measure in feet is not
recorded, but he stood upon the ground and plucked cocoanuts from the
tallest trees, and once, without wetting his loins, strode out into six
fathoms of water and saved the life of his chief. As the traditions
relating to Umi are quite elaborate and circumstantial, the existence
of Maukaleoleo cannot well be doubted, however greatly we may feel
disposed to curtail his proportions.</p>
<p>But, in groping among these monsters of the Hawaiian past, we have
been led somewhat from the story of the irruption in Puna, to which
reference has been made. However, as pertinent to it, and to the
goddess whose wrath invoked it, it may be mentioned that many centuries
ago a family of gods and goddesses came to Hawaii from Tahiti and took
possession of the volcanic mountains of that island. The family
consisted of five <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb504" href="#pb504"
name="pb504">504</a>]</span>brothers and nine sisters, of which Pele
was the principal deity. The others possessed specific powers and
functions, such as controlling the fires, smoke, steam, explosions,
etc., of the volcanoes under their supervision. Although they
frequently dwelt in other volcanoes, their principal and favorite abode
was the crater of Kilauea. Almost without exception they were
destructive and merciless. Temples were erected to Pele in every
district menaced by volcanic disturbance, and offerings of fruits,
animals, and sometimes of human beings were laid upon her altars and
thrown into the crater to secure her favor or placate her wrath. In the
legend of &ldquo;The Apotheosis of Pele&rdquo; a more extended
reference is made to the goddess and her family.</p>
<p>With this knowledge of the power and disposition of Pele, the reader
will be prepared for the story of the exhibition of her wrath in Puna,
which will now be related nearly in the language of tradition. The
event occurred during the reign of Kahoukapu, who from about 1340 to
1380 was the <i>alii-nui</i>, or governing chief, of Hawaii. The chief
of the district of Puna was Kahavari, a young noble distinguished for
his strength, courage and manly accomplishments. How he came to be
chief or governor of Puna is not stated. As his father and sister lived
on Oahu, he was probably a native of that island, and may have been
advanced to his position through military service rendered the Hawaiian
king, since it was customary in those days, as it was at later periods,
for young men of martial tastes to seek adventure and employment at
arms with the kings and chiefs of neighboring islands.</p>
<p>The grass-thatched mansion of the young chief was near Kapoho, where
his wife lived with their two children, Paupoulu and Kaohe; and at
Kukii, no great distance away, dwelt his old mother, then on a visit to
her distinguished son. As his <i>taro</i> lands were large and fertile,
and he had fish-ponds on the sea-shore, he entertained with
prodigality, and the people of Puna thought there was no chief like him
in all Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was at the time of the monthly festival of <i>Lono</i>. The day
was beautiful. The trade-winds were bending the leaves of the palms and
scattering the spray from the breakers chasing each other over the
reef. A <i>holua</i> contest had been announced between the stalwart
young chief and his favorite friend and companion, Ahua, and a large
concourse of men, women and children <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb505" href="#pb505" name="pb505">505</a>]</span>had assembled at the
foot of the hill to witness the exciting pastime. They brought with
them drums, <i>ohes</i>, <i>ulilis</i>, rattling gourds and other
musical instruments, and while they awaited the coming of the
contestants all frolicked as if they were children&mdash;frolicked as
was their way before the white man came to tell them they were nearly
naked, and that life was too serious a thing to be frittered away in
enjoyment. They ate <i>ohias</i>, cocoanuts and bananas under the
palms, and chewed the pith of sugar-cane. They danced, sang and laughed
at the <i>hula</i> and other sports of the children, and grew nervous
with enthusiasm when their bards chanted the <i>meles</i> of by-gone
years.</p>
<p>The game of <i>holua</i> consists in sliding down a sometimes long
but always steep hill on a narrow sledge from six to twelve feet in
length, called a <i>papa</i>. The light and polished runners, bent
upward at the front, are bound quite closely together, with cross-bars
for the hands and feet. With a run at the top of the sliding track,
slightly smoothed and sometimes strewn with rushes, the rider throws
himself face downward on the narrow <i>papa</i> and dashes headlong
down the hill. As the sledge is not more than six or eight inches in
width, with more than as many feet in length, one of the principal
difficulties of the descent is in keeping it under the rider; the
other, of course, is in guiding it; but long practice is required to
master the subtleties of either. Kahavari was an adept with the
<i>papa</i>, and so was Ahua. Rare sport was therefore expected, and
the people of the neighborhood assembled almost in a body to witness
it.</p>
<p>Finally appearing at the foot of the hill, Kahavari and his
companion were heartily cheered by their good-natured auditors. Their
<i>papas</i> were carried by attendants. The chief smiled upon the
assemblage, and as he struck his tall spear into the ground and
divested his broad shoulders of the <i>kihei</i> covering them, the
wagers of fruit and pigs were three to one that he would reach the
bottom first, although Ahua was expert with the <i>papa</i>, and but a
month before had beaten the champion of Kau on his own ground.</p>
<p>Taking their sledges under their arms, the contestants laughingly
mounted the hill with firm, strong strides, neither thinking of resting
until the top was gained. Stopping for a moment preparatory to the
descent, a comely-looking woman stepped out from behind a clump of
undergrowth and bowed before them. Little attention was paid to her
until she approached still nearer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb506"
href="#pb506" name="pb506">506</a>]</span>and boldly challenged
Kahavari to contest the <i>holua</i> with her instead of Ahua.
Exchanging a smile of amusement with his companion, the chief scanned
the lithe and shapely figure of the woman for a moment, and then
exclaimed, more in astonishment than in anger: &ldquo;What! with a
woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not with a woman, if she is your superior and you
lack not the courage?&rdquo; was the calm rejoinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are bold, woman,&rdquo; returned the chief, with
something of a frown. &ldquo;What know you of the
<i>papa</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough to reach the bottom of the hill in front of the chief
of Puna,&rdquo; was the prompt and defiant answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it so, indeed? Then take the <i>papa</i> and we will
see!&rdquo; said Kahavari, with an angry look which did not seem to
disturb the woman in the least.</p>
<p>At a motion from the chief, Ahua handed his <i>papa</i> to the
woman, and the next moment Kahavari, with the strange contestant
closely behind him, was dashing down the hill. On, on they went, around
and over rocks, at break-neck speed; but for a moment the woman lost
her balance, and Kahavari reached the end of the course a dozen paces
in advance.</p>
<p>Music and shouting followed the victory of the chief, and, scowling
upon the exultant multitude, the woman pointed to the hill, silently
challenging the victor to another trial. They mounted the hill without
a word, and turned for another start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said the woman, while a strange light flashed in
her eyes. &ldquo;Your <i>papa</i> is better than mine. If you would act
fairly, let us now exchange!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I exchange?&rdquo; replied the chief, hastily.
&ldquo;You are neither my wife nor my sister, and I know you not.
Come<span class="corr" id="xd26e13887" title=
"Source: &rdquo;!">!&rdquo;</span> And, presuming the woman was
following him, Kahavari made a spring and dashed down the hill on his
<i>papa</i>.</p>
<p>With this the woman stamped her foot, and a river of burning lava
burst from the hill and began to pour down into the valley beneath.
Reaching the bottom, Kahavari rose and looked behind him, and to his
horror saw a wide and wild torrent of lava rushing down the hillside
toward the spot where he was standing; and riding on the crest of the
foremost wave was the woman&mdash;now no longer disguised, but Pele,
the dreadful goddess of Kilauea&mdash;with thunder at her feet and
lightning playing with her flaming tresses. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb507" href="#pb507" name="pb507">507</a>]</span></p>
<p>Seizing his spear, Kahavari, accompanied by Ahua, fled for his life
to the small eminence of Puukea. He looked behind, and saw the entire
assemblage of spectators engulfed in a sea of fire. With terrible
rapidity the valleys began to fill, and he knew that his only hope of
escape was in reaching the ocean, for it was manifest that Pele was
intent upon his destruction. He fled to his house, and, passing it
without stopping, said farewell to his mother, wife and children, and
to his favorite hog Aloipuaa. Telling them that Pele was in pursuit of
him with a river of fire, and to save themselves, if possible, by
escaping to the hills, he left them to their fate.</p>
<p>Coming to a chasm, he saw Pele pouring down it to cut off his
retreat. He crossed on his spear, pulling his friend over after him. At
length, closely pursued, he reached the ocean. His brother, discovering
the danger, had just landed from his fishing canoe and gone to look
after the safety of his family. Kahavari leaped into the canoe with his
companion, and, using his spear for a paddle, was soon beyond the reach
of the pursuing lava. Enraged at his escape, Pele ran some distance
into the water and hurled after him huge stones, that hissed as they
struck the waves, until an east wind sprang up and carried him far out
to sea.</p>
<p>He first reached the island of Maui, and thence by the way of Lanai
found his way to Oahu, where he remained to the end of his days. All of
his relatives in Puna perished, with hundreds of others in the
neighborhood of Kapoho. But he never ventured back to Puna, the grave
of his hopes and his people, for he believed Pele, the unforgiving,
would visit the place with another horror if he did.</p>
<p>Pele had come down from Kilauea in a pleasant mood to witness the
<i>holua</i> contest; but Kahavari angered her unwittingly, and what
followed has just been described. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb509"

<p class="first">Manoa is the most beautiful of all the little valleys
leaping abruptly from the mountains back of Honolulu and cooling the
streets and byways of the city with their sweet waters. And it is also
the most verdant. Gentle rains fall there more frequently than in the
valleys on either side of it, and almost every day in the year it is
canopied with rainbows. Sometimes it is called, and not
inappropriately, the Valley of Rainbows.</p>
<p>Why is it that Manoa is thus blessed with rains, thus ornamented
with rainbows, thus cradled in everlasting green? Were a reason sought
among natural causes, it would doubtless be found in a favoring rent or
depression in the summit above the valley, and overlooking the eastern
coast of Oahu, where wind and rain are abundant. But tradition
furnishes another explanation of the exceptionally kind dealings of the
elements with Manoa&mdash;not as satisfactory, perhaps, as the one
suggested, but very much more poetic.</p>
<p>Far back in the past, as the story relates, the projecting spur of
Akaaka, above the head of Manoa Valley, was united in marriage with the
neighboring promontory of Nalehuaakaaka. A growth of <i>lehua</i>
bushes still crowns the spur in perpetual witness of the union. Of this
marriage of mountains twin children were born&mdash;a boy named
Kahaukani, which signified Manoa wind, and a girl called Kauahuahine,
which implied Manoa rain. At their birth they were adopted by a chief
and chiefess whose names were Kolowahi and Pohakukala. They were
brother and sister, and cousins, also, of Akaaka. The brother took
charge of the boy, and the sister assumed the custody and care of the
girl. Reared apart from each other, and kept in ignorance of their
close relationship, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb512" href="#pb512"
name="pb512">512</a>]</span>through the management of their
foster-parents they were brought together at the proper age and
married. The fruit of this union was a daughter, who was given the name
of Kahalaopuna, and who became the most beautiful woman of her time.
Thus it was that the marriage of the Wind (Kahaukani) and Rain
(Kauahuahine) of Manoa brought to the valley as an inheritance the
rainbows and showers for which it has since been distinguished.</p>
<p>To continue the story of the ancient bards of Oahu,
Kahalaopuna&mdash;or Kaha, as the name will hereafter be
written&mdash;grew to a surpassingly beautiful womanhood. A house was
built for her in a grove of sandal-trees at Kahaiamano, where she lived
with a few devoted servants. The house was embowered in vines, and two
<i>poloulou</i>, or <i>tabu</i> staves, were kept standing beside the
entrance, to indicate that they guarded from intrusion a person of high
rank. Her eyes were so bright that their glow penetrated the thatch of
her <i>hale</i>, and a luminous glimmer played around its openings.
When bathing a roseate halo surrounded her, and a similar light is
still visible, it is claimed, whenever her spirit revisits
Kahaiamano.</p>
<p>In infancy Kaha was betrothed to Kauhi, a young chief of Kailua,
whose parents were so sensible of the honor of the proposed union that
they always provided her table with <i>poi</i> of their own making and
choice fish from the ponds of Kawainui. The acceptance of these favors
placed her under obligations to the parents of Kauhi and kept her in
continual remembrance of her betrothal. Hence she gave no encouragement
to the many chiefs of distinction who sought to obtain glimpses of her
beauty and annoyed her with proffers of marriage. The chief to whom she
was betrothed was, like herself, of something more than human descent,
and she felt herself already bound to him by ties too sacred to be
broken.</p>
<p>The fame of her beauty spread far and near, and people came from
long distances to catch glimpses of her from lands adjoining, as she
walked to and from her bathing-pool or strolled in the shelter of the
trees surrounding her house. Among those who many times approached her
dwelling but failed to see her were Keawaawakiihelei and Kumauna, two
inferior chiefs, whose eyes were disfigured by an unnatural distention
of the lower lids. In ungenerous revenge, and envious of those who had
fared better, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb513" href="#pb513" name=
"pb513">513</a>]</span>they decked themselves with <i>leis</i> of
flowers, and, repairing to the bathing-place at Waikiki, boasted that
the garlands had been placed around their necks by the beautiful Kaha,
with whom they affected the greatest intimacy.</p>
<p>Among the bathers at that popular resort was Kauhi. Although the day
fixed for his marriage with Kaha was near at hand, he had never seen
her&mdash;this being one of the conditions of the betrothal. The
stories of the two miscreants were repeated until Kauhi at length gave
them credence, and in a fit of jealous fury he resolved to kill the
beautiful enchantress who had thus trifled with his love.</p>
<p>Leaving Waikiki in the morning, he reached Kahaiamano about midday.
Breaking from a pandanus-tree a heavy cone of nuts with a short limb
attached, he presented himself at the house of Kaha. She had just awoke
from a nap, and was about to proceed to her bathing-pond, when she was
startled at observing a stranger at her door. He did not speak, but
from frequent descriptions she at length recognized him as Kauhi, and
with some embarrassment invited him to enter. Declining, and admitting
his identity, he requested her to step without, and she unhesitatingly
complied. His first intention was to kill her at once; but her supreme
loveliness and ready obedience unnerved him for the time, and he
proposed that she should first bathe and then accompany him in a ramble
through the woods.</p>
<p>To this she assented, and while she was absent Kauhi stood by the
door, moodily watching the bright light playing above the pond where
she was bathing. He was profoundly impressed with her great beauty, and
would have given half the years of his life to clasp her in his arms
unsullied. The very thought intensified his jealousy; and when his mind
reverted to the disgusting objects upon whom he believed she had
bestowed her favors, he resolved to show her no mercy, and impatiently
awaited her return.</p>
<p>Finishing her bath and rejoining him at the door, her beauty was so
enrapturing that he was afraid to look at her face, lest he might again
falter; it was therefore with his back turned to her that he declined
to partake of food before they departed, and motioned her to follow
him. His actions were so strange that she said to him, half in
alarm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you, indeed, angered with me? Have I in any way
displeased you? Speak, that I may know my fault!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb514" href="#pb514" name="pb514">514</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, foolish girl, what could you have done to displease
me?&rdquo; replied Kauhi, evasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, I hope,&rdquo; returned Kaha; &ldquo;yet your look
is cold and almost frightens me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my mood to-day, perhaps,&rdquo; answered Kauhi,
increasing his pace to give employment to his thoughts; &ldquo;you will
think better of my looks, no doubt, when we are of longer
acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They kept on together, he leading and she following, until they
reached a large rock in Aihualama, when he turned abruptly, and,
seizing the girl by the arm, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are beautiful&mdash;so beautiful that your face almost
drives me mad; but you have been false and must die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kaha&rsquo;s first thought was that he was making sport with her;
but when she looked up into his face and saw that it was stern and
smileless, she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are resolved upon my death, why did you not kill me at
home, so that my bones might be buried by my people? If you think me
false, tell me with whom, that I may disabuse your mind of the cruel
error possessing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your words are as fair as your face, but neither will deceive
me longer!&rdquo; exclaimed Kauhi; and with a blow on the temple with
the cone of <i>hala</i> nuts, which he was still carrying, he laid her
dead at his feet. Hastily digging a hole beside the rock, he buried the
body and started down the valley toward Waikiki.</p>
<p>He had scarcely left before a large owl&mdash;a god in that guise,
who was related to Kaha and had followed her&mdash;unearthed the body,
rubbed his head against the bruised temple, and restored the girl to
life. Overtaking Kauhi, Kaha sang behind him a lament at his
unkindness. Turning in amazement, he observed the owl flying above her
head, and recognized the power that had restored her to life.</p>
<p>Again ordering Kaha to follow him, they ascended the ridge dividing
the valleys of Manoa and Nuuanu. The way was beset with sharp rocks and
tangled undergrowth, and when Kaha reached the summit her tender feet
were bleeding and her <i>pau</i> was in tatters. Seating herself on a
stone to regain her breath, with tears in her eyes she implored Kauhi
to tell her whither he was leading her and why he had sought to kill
her. His only reply was a blow with the <i>hala</i> cone, which again
felled her dead <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb515" href="#pb515"
name="pb515">515</a>]</span>to the earth. Burying the body as before he
resumed his way toward Waikiki.</p>
<p>Again flying to the rescue of his beautiful and sinless relative,
the owl-god scratched away the earth above her and restored her once
more to life. Following Kauhi, she again chanted a song of lament
behind him, and begged him to be merciful to one who had never wronged
him, even in thought. Hearing her voice, he turned, and without answer
conducted her across the valley of Nuuanu to the ridge of Waolani,
where he killed and buried her as he had done twice before, and the
owl-god a third time removed the earth from the body and gave it
life.</p>
<p>She again overtook her merciless companion, and again pleaded for
life and forgiveness for her unknown fault. Instead of softening his
heart, the words of Kaha enraged him, and he resolved not to be
thwarted in his determination to take her life. Leading her to the head
of Kalihi valley, where she was for the fourth time killed, buried and
resurrected as before, he next conducted her across plains and steep
ravines to Pohakea, on the Ewa slope of the Kaala mountains. He hoped
the owl-god would not follow them so far, but, looking around, he
discovered him among the branches of an <i>ohia</i> tree not far
distant.</p>
<p>As Kaha was worn down with fatigue, it required but a slight blow to
kill her the fifth time, and when it was dealt to the unresisting girl
her body was buried under the roots of a large <i>koa</i> tree, and
there left by Kauhi, satisfied that it could not be reached by the
owl-god. Repairing to the spot after the departure of Kauhi, the owl
put himself to the task of scratching the earth from the body; but his
claws became entangled with the roots, which had been left to embarrass
his labors, and, after toiling for some time and making little or no
progress, he abandoned the undertaking as hopeless, and, reluctantly
left the unfortunate girl to her fate, following Kauhi to Waikiki.</p>
<p>But there had been another witness to these many deaths and
restorations of Kaha. It was a little green bird that had flitted along
unobserved either by Kaha or her companion, and had followed them from
Kahaiamano, flying from tree to tree and making no noise. Noting with
regret that the owl-god had abandoned the body of Kaha, the little
bird, which was a cousin to the girl and a supernatural being, flew
with haste to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb516" href="#pb516"
name="pb516">516</a>]</span>parents of Kaha, and informed them of all
that had happened to their daughter.</p>
<p>The girl had been missed, but as some of her servants had recognized
Kauhi, and had seen her leave the house with him, her absence
occasioned no uneasiness; and when the little green bird, whose name
was Elepaio, recounted to the parents the story of Kaha&rsquo;s great
suffering and many deaths, they found it difficult to believe that
Kauhi could have been guilty of such fiendish cruelty to the radiant
being who was about to become his wife. They were convinced of
Elepaio&rsquo;s sincerity, however, and with great grief prepared to
visit the spot and remove the remains of Kaha for more fitting
interment.</p>
<p>Meantime the spirit of the murdered girl discovered itself to
Mahana, a young chief of good address, who was returning from a visit
to Waianae. Directed by the apparition, he proceeded to the <i>koa</i>
tree, and, removing the earth and roots, discovered the body of Kaha.
He recognized the face at once, notwithstanding the blood and earth
stains disfiguring its faultless regularity. He had seen and become
enraptured with its beauty at Kahaiamano, and on one occasion, which
lived in his memory like a beautiful dream, he had been emboldened by
his love to approach sufficiently near to exchange modest words and
glances with it.</p>
<p>Gently removing the body from the shallow pit in which it had been
buried, Mahana found to his great joy that it was still warm. Wrapping
it in his <i>kihei</i>, or shoulder scarf, and covering it with
<i>maile</i> ferns and ginger, he tenderly bore it in his arms to his
home at Kamoiliili. As he walked he chanted his love and scarcely felt
his burden. Reaching home, he laid the body upon a <i>kapa-moe</i>, and
earnestly implored his elder brother to restore it to life, he being a
<i>kahuna</i> and having skill in such matters.</p>
<p>Examining the body and finding that he could do nothing unaided, the
brother called upon their two spirit-sisters for assistance, and
through their instrumentality the soul of Kaha was once more restored
to its beautiful tenement. But it was some time before she fully
recovered from the effects of her cruel treatment&mdash;some time, in
fact, before she was able to walk without support. In her convalescence
Mahana was her considerate and constant companion, and found no greater
pleasure than in providing her with the delicacies to which she had
been accustomed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb517" href="#pb517"
name="pb517">517</a>]</span>She was greatly benefited by the waters of
the underground cave of Mauoki, to which she was frequently and
secretly taken, and under the watchful care of Mahana she was at length
restored to health.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With her recovery, in the home of her new friends at
Kamoiliili, Kaha was introduced to a life that was new to her; but it
was by no means an unpleasant change from the restraints of her
listless and more sumptuous past behind the protecting shadows of her
<i>puloulous</i>, where she was jealously watched, and where rank
closed her doors to congenial companionship. She repaired to an
unfrequented beach, and, unobserved, played with the shifting sands and
sang to the waves, and at night went with Mahana to the reef with torch
and spear in search of fish and squid.</p>
<p>Knowing that her restoration to life could not be long kept from her
relatives, Mahana told her that his love for her was great, and asked
her to become his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never love any one better than Mahana,&rdquo; replied
Kaha; &ldquo;but from infancy I have been betrothed to Kauhi; my
parents, the Wind and Rain of Manoa, have promised that I shall be his
wife, and while he lives I can be the wife of no other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The argument that Kauhi had forfeited all right to her by his
cruelties failed to shake her resolution, and the brother of Mahana
advised him to in some manner compass the death of Kauhi. To this end
they apprised the parents of Kaha of her restoration to life, and
conspired with them to keep secret the information for a time. This
they were the more disposed to do because of their uncertainty
concerning what Kauhi might again attempt should he find the girl
alive.</p>
<p>In pursuance of the plan adopted, Mahana learned from Kaha all the
songs she had chanted to mollify the wrath of Kauhi while she was
following him through the mountains, and then sought the <i>kilu</i>
houses of the king and chiefs in the hope of encountering his rival. It
was not long before they met, under just such circumstances as Mahana
desired. He discovered Kauhi engaged with others in the game of
<i>kilu</i>, and joined the party as a player. The <i>kilu</i> passed
from the hand of Kauhi to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb518" href=
"#pb518" name="pb518">518</a>]</span>Mahana, who, on receiving it,
began to chant the first of Kaha&rsquo;s songs.</p>
<p>Surprised and embarrassed, Kauhi, in violation of the rules of the
game, stopped the player to inquire where he had learned the words of
the song he was singing. The answer was that he had learned them from
Kaha, the noted beauty of Manoa, who was a friend of his sister, and
was then visiting them at their home. Knowing that she had been
deserted by the owl-god, and feeling assured that Kaha was no longer
living, Kauhi denounced as a falsehood the explanation of the player.
Bitter words followed, and but for the interference of friends there
would have been bloodshed.</p>
<p>They met the next day at the <i>kilu</i> house, and in the evening
following, when similar scenes occurred between Mahana and his rival,
Kauhi became so enraged at length that he admitted that he had killed
the beautiful Kaha of Manoa, and declared the Kaha of Mahana to be an
impostor, who had heard of the death of the real Kaha and audaciously
assumed her name and rank. He then challenged Mahana to produce the
woman claiming to be Kaha, agreeing to forfeit his life should she
prove in flesh and blood to be the one whom he knew to be dead, and
subjecting Mahana to a like penalty in the event of the claimant
proving to be other than the person he represented her to be.</p>
<p>It had been the purpose of Mahana to provoke his rival to a combat
with weapons, but the challenge of Kauhi presented itself as a more
satisfactory means of accomplishing the object of his aim, and he
promptly accepted it; and, that both might be more firmly bound to its
conditions, they were repeated and formally ratified in the presence of
the king and principal chiefs of the district.</p>
<p>The day fixed for the strange trial arrived. It was to be in the
presence of the king and a number of distinguished chiefs, and Akaaka,
the grandfather of Kaha, had been selected as one of the judges.
<i>Imus</i> had been erected near the sea-shore by the respective
friends of the contestants, in which to roast alive the vanquished
chief, and dry wood for the heating was piled beside them.</p>
<p>Fearing that the spirit of the murdered girl might be able to assume
a living appearance, and thus impose upon the judges, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb519" href="#pb519" name=
"pb519">519</a>]</span>Kauhi had consulted the priests and sorcerers of
his family, and was advised by Kaea to have the large and tender leaves
of the ape plant spread upon the ground where Kaha and her attendants
before the tribunal were to be seated. &ldquo;When she enters,&rdquo;
said the <i>kaula</i>, &ldquo;watch her closely. If she is of flesh her
weight will rend the leaves; if she is merely a spirit the leaves where
she walks and sits will not be torn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On her way to Waikiki, the place designated for the trial, Kaha was
accompanied by her parents, friends and servants, and also by the two
spirit-sisters of Mahana, who had assumed human forms in order to be
better able to advise and assist her, if occasion required. They
informed her of Kaea&rsquo;s proposed test with ape leaves, and advised
her to quietly tear and rend them as far as possible for some distance
around her, in order that the spirit-friends beside her, who would be
unable to do as much for themselves, might thereby escape detection. If
discovered, they would be exposed to the risk of being killed by the
<i>poe-poi-uhane</i>, or spirit-catchers.</p>
<p>Arriving at Waikiki, Kaha and her companions repaired to the large
enclosure in which the trial was to take place. The king, chiefs,
judges and advisers of Kauhi were already there, and thousands of
spectators were assembled in the grounds adjoining. The ape leaves had
been spread, by the consent of the king, as advised by Kaea, and Kaha
entered with her friends and advanced to the place reserved for them.
Not far from her stood Kauhi. As he bent forward in anxiety and looked
into her star-like eyes, with a sinking heart he saw that their
reproachful gleam was human, and knew that he had lost the wager of his
life.</p>
<p>Observing her instructions, Kaha took pains to quietly rend and
rumple the ape leaves under and around her. So far as she was
concerned, the test was satisfactory. The evidence of the leaves torn
by her feet could not be questioned. Kaea was therefore compelled to
admit that Kaha was a being of flesh and bone; but in his
disappointment he declared that he saw and felt the presence of spirits
in some manner connected with her, and would detect and punish
them.</p>
<p>Irritated at the malice of the <i>kaula</i>, Akaaka advised him to
look for the faces of the spirits in an open calabash of water. Eagerly
grasping at the suggestion, Kaea ordered a vessel of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb520" href="#pb520" name=
"pb520">520</a>]</span>clear water to be brought in, and incautiously
bent his eyes over it. He saw only the reflection of his own face.
Akaaka also caught a glimpse of it, and, knowing it to be the spirit of
the seer, he seized and crushed it between his palms, and Kaea fell
dead to the earth beside the calabash into which he had been
peering.</p>
<p>Akaaka then turned and embraced Kaha, acknowledging that she was his
granddaughter, and that her purity and obedience rendered her worthy of
the love of the bold upland of Akaaka, and of her parents, the Wind and
Rain of Manoa.</p>
<p>The curiosity of the king was aroused, and he demanded an
explanation of the strange proceedings he had just witnessed. Kaha told
her simple story, and Kauhi, on being interrogated, could deny no part
of it. As an excuse for his barbarous conduct, however, he repeated,
and attributed his jealous rage to, the boastful assertions of Kumauna
and Keawaawakiihelei. The slanderers were sent for at once, and, on
being confronted by Kaha, admitted that they had never seen her before,
and that they had boasted of their intimacy with her to make others
envious of their good fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the king, after listening to the
confessions of the miscreants, &ldquo;as your efforts in exciting the
envy of others have brought terrible suffering to an innocent girl, I
now promise you something of which no one, I think, will envy you. You
will be baked alive with Kauhi! If you have friends among the gods,
pray to them that the <i>imus</i> may be hot and your sufferings
short!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>imus</i> were ordered to be heated at once, and Kauhi and the
two calumniators were thrown into them alive and roasted. The first
went to his death bravely, chanting a song of defiance as he proceeded
to the place of execution, but the others vainly struggled and sought
to escape. The retainers of Kauhi were so disgusted with his cruelty to
Kaha that they transferred their allegiance to her, and the lands and
fishing rights that had been his were given to Mahana at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you intend to reward the young chief who hazarded
his life for you?&rdquo; inquired the king, pleasantly addressing Kaha
as he rose to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With my own, O king!&rdquo; replied the girl, advancing to
Mahana and laying her head upon his breast. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb521" href="#pb521" name="pb521">521</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;So shall it be, indeed,&rdquo; returned the king. &ldquo;I
have said it, and you are now the wife of Mahana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his gratitude the happy young chief threw himself at the feet of
the king and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your slave, great king! Demand of me some great service
or sacrifice, that you may know that I am grateful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even as you desire,&rdquo; returned the king, &ldquo;I will
put you to a task that will tax to the utmost your patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I listen, O king!&rdquo; said Mahana, resolutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sacrifice I ask,&rdquo; resumed the king, with a merry
twinkle in his eye, &ldquo;is that for full three days from this time
you embrace not your bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sacrifice, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Mahana, catching the
kindly humor of the request, and slyly glancing at the downcast face of
Kaha. &ldquo;It is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too great, I see, for one whose beard is not yet fully
grown,&rdquo; interrupted the king. &ldquo;Well, I withdraw the
request. The girl is yours; take her with you without
conditions!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Here the story of the trials of Kaha should end; but it does not.
Some time during the night following the death of Kauhi a tidal wave,
sent by a powerful shark-god, swept over and destroyed the <i>imus</i>
in which the condemned men had been roasted, and their bones were
carried into the sea. Through the power of their family gods Kumauna
and Keawaawakiihelei were transformed into two peaks in the mountains
back of Manoa Valley while Kauhi, who was distantly related to the
shark-god, was turned into a shark.</p>
<p>For two years Kaha and her husband lived happily together,
surrounded by many friends and enjoying every comfort. Her grandfather,
Akaaka, visited her frequently, and, knowing of Kauhi&rsquo;s
transformation and vindictive disposition, admonished her to avoid the
sea. For two years she heeded the warning; but one day, when her
husband was absent and her mother was asleep, she ventured with one of
her women to the beach to witness the sports of the bathers and
surf-riders. As no harm came to the swimmers, and the water was
inviting, she finally borrowed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb522"
href="#pb522" name="pb522">522</a>]</span>a surf-board, and, throwing
herself joyfully into the waves, was carried beyond the reef.</p>
<p>This was the opportunity for which Kauhi had long waited. Seizing
Kaha, and biting her body in twain, he swam around with the head and
shoulders exposed above the water, that the bathers might note his
triumph. The spirit of Kaha at once returned to the sleeping mother and
informed her of what had befallen her daughter. Waking and missing
Kaha, the mother gave the alarm, and with others immediately proceeded
to the beach. The bathers, who had fled from the water on witnessing
the fate of Kaha, confirmed the words of the spirit, and canoes were
launched in pursuit of the shark, still exhibiting his bloody trophy
beyond the reef.</p>
<p>Swimming with the body of Kaha just far enough below the surface to
be visible to the occupants of the canoes, the monster was followed to
Waianae, where in shallow waters he was seen, with other sharks, to
completely devour the remains. This rendered her restoration to life
impossible, and the pursuing party returned sadly to Waikiki.</p>
<p>With the final death of Kaha her parents relinquished their human
lives and retired to Manoa Valley. The father is known as Manoa Wind,
and his visible form is a small grove of <i>hau</i> trees below
Kahaiamano. The mother is recognized as Manoa Rain, and is often met
with in the vicinity of the former home of her beloved and beautiful
daughter.</p>
<p>The grandparents of Kaha also abandoned their human forms, Akaaka
resuming his personation of the mountain spur bearing his name, and his
august companion nestling upon his brow in the shape of a thicket of
<i>lehua</i> bushes. And there, among the clouds, they still look down
upon Kahaiamano and the fair valley of Manoa, and smile at the rains of
Kauahuahine, which day by day renew their beauty, and keep green with
ferns and sweet with flowers the earthly home of Kahalaopuna.

<h3 class="main">EXPLANATORY NOTE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Hawaiian alphabet proper contains but twelve
letters, five vowels and seven consonants, namely: A, E, I, O, U, H, K,
L, M, N, P, W. To these are sometimes added R, T and B. No appreciable
distinction, however, is observed between the sounds of R and L, T and
K, and B and P.</p>
<p>The almost invariable sound of A is as pronounced in f<i>a</i>ther;
of E as in th<i>e</i>y; of I as in mar<i>i</i>ne; of O as in
m<i>o</i>le; of U as in m<i>u</i>te. The only general deviation is in
giving the vowels long and short sounds. W takes the sound of V in most
cases.</p>
<p>Every word and every syllable of the language ends in a vowel, and
no two consonants occur without a vowel sound between them.</p>
<p>The accent of nine-tenths of the words in the language is on the
penultimate.</p>
<p>The indefinite article is <i>he</i>; the definite article <i>ka</i>
or <i>ke</i>; the plural takes the prefix of <i>na</i>.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;O&rdquo; beginning the metrical lines of chants and
<i>meles</i> is not always employed as an interjection. It is used
chiefly as a prefix to personal nouns and pronouns in the nominative
case.</p>
